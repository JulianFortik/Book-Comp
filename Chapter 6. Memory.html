<p class="noindent">Computer systems need software to operate; without software, a computer is an expensive doorstop. For a computer to operate, the software must reside in computer memory. Upgrading memory is simple, but a technician must understand memory terminology, determine the optimum amount of memory for a system, install the memory, fine-tune it for the best performance, and troubleshoot and solve any memory problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The two main types of memory are <strong><a id="ch06term24" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0788" class="pd_blue">RAM</a></strong> (random-access memory) and ROM (read-only memory), and the difference between them is shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig01">Figure 6.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_203"></a>RAM is divided into two major types: <strong><a id="ch06term11" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0272" class="pd_blue">DRAM</a></strong> (dynamic RAM) and <strong><a id="ch06term35" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0935" class="pd_blue">SRAM</a></strong> (static RAM). DRAM is less expensive but slower than SRAM. With DRAM, the 1s and 0s inside the chip must be refreshed. Over time, the charge, which represents information inside a DRAM chip, leaks out. The information, stored in 1s and 0s, is periodically rewritten to the memory chip through the <strong><a id="ch06term26" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0805" class="pd_blue">refreshing</a></strong> process. The refreshing is accomplished inside the DRAM while other processing occurs. Refreshing is one reason DRAM chips are slower than SRAM.</p>
<p class="indent">Most memory on a motherboard is DRAM, but a small amount of SRAM can be found inside the processor inside the processor housing, and sometimes on the motherboard. SRAM is also known as <strong><a id="ch06term02" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0116" class="pd_blue">cache memory</a></strong>. Cache memory holds the most frequently used data so the CPU does not return to the slower DRAM chips to obtain the data. For example, on a motherboard with a bus speed of 233MHz, accessing DRAM could take as long as 90 nanoseconds. (A nanosecond [ns] is one-billionth of a second.) Accessing the same information in cache could take as little as 23 nanoseconds.</p>

<p class="notepara">Using pipelined burst cache speeds up processing for software applications.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The CPU fetches a software instruction from memory, and then the processor sits idle. In a fast-food restaurant, this is the same as not allowing waiting customers to be served until the first customer has his or her food. Most restaurants serve the next customer while the food is being prepared and open more registers when lots of customers are waiting. With pipelining, the processor is allowed to obtain more software instructions without waiting for the first instruction to be executed. Opening more registers is similar to how manufacturers use processor models with more pipelines. Using cache memory and using pipelining are popular technologies used today.</p>
<p class="indent">The data or instruction that the processor needs is usually found in one of three places: cache, DRAM, or the hard drive. Cache gives the fastest access. If the information is not in cache, the processor looks for it in DRAM. If the information is not in DRAM, it is retrieved from the hard drive and placed into DRAM or the cache. Hard drive access is the slowest of the three. In a computer, it takes roughly a million times longer to access information from the hard drive than it does from DRAM or cache.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">When determining a computerâs memory requirements, you must take into consideration the operating system used, applications used, and hardware installed. The Windows XP operating system takes a lot less memory than do Windows 7 and 8. High-end games and desktop publishing take more RAM than word processing.</p>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec2"><span class="pd_blue">Memory Physical Packaging</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A DIP (dual in-line package) chip has a row of legs running down each side. The oldest motherboards use DIP chips for the DRAM. <strong><a id="ch06term31" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0899" class="pd_blue">SIMMs</a></strong> (single in-line memory modules) came along next. Two types of SIMMs were used: 30-pin and 72-pin.

<h3 id="ch06lev1sec3"><span class="pd_blue">Planning the Memory Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you know a little about memory types, let us look at the practical sideâhow to go about planning a memory installation. Some key points to follow:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Refer to the system or motherboard documentation to see what type of memory is supported.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Determine what features are supported.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Determine how much memory is needed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Determine how many of each memory module is needed.</p>

<h3 id="ch06lev1sec4"><a id="page_205"></a><span class="pd_blue">Planning the Memory InstallationâMemory Technologies</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Technology has provided faster DRAM speeds without increasing the cost too greatly. These DRAM technologies include FPM (fast page mode) RAM, EDO (extended data out) RAM, BEDO (burst EDO) RAM, SDRAM (synchronous DRAM), DDR (double data rate) RAM, and RDRAM (Rambus DRAM). The motherboard must be designed to use one of these technologies, or the faster memory <em>will not</em> speed up the computer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab01">Table 6.1</a> explains some of the memory technologies.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 6. Memory_files/06tab01.jpg" alt="Image" width="850" height="796"></div>
<p class="indent">Whether a motherboard supports faster memory chips is determined by the chipset, which performs most functions in conjunction with the processor. A chipset is one to five electronic chips on the motherboard. The chipset contains the circuitry to control the local bus, memory, DMA, interrupts, and cache memory. The motherboard manufacturer determines which chipset to use.</p>

<p class="indent">Most people cannot tell the difference between DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 memory modules. Even though DDR uses 184 pins and DDR2/3 use 240 pins, they are the same physical size. DDR3 modules also have 240 pins but will not fit in a DDR2 slot. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig04">Figure 6.4</a> shows DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMs, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab02">Table 6.2</a> lists many of the DIMM models.</p>

<p class="indent">Because a DIMM can be shown with either the PC<em>x</em>- or DDR<em>x</em>- designation, which type you are buying can be confusing. A brief explanation might help. DDR2-800 is a type of DDR2 memory that can run on a 400Hz front side bus (the number after DDR2 divided in half). Another way of showing the same chip would be to use the designation PC2-6400, which is the theoretical bandwidth of the memory chip in MBps.</p>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec5"><a id="page_207"></a><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Memory</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Laptop, netbook, and tablet computers are major parts of todayâs business environment. The memory chips used with laptops are different from the ones used in desktop or tower computers. Portables that use DIMMs use special types such as a <strong><a id="ch06term33" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0919" class="pd_blue">SO-DIMM</a></strong> (small-outline DIMM). Older laptops used a 144- or 172-pin microDIMM. The portable computers that used RIMMs used SO-RIMMs (small-outline RIMMs). SO-DIMMs are the most popular, and they come in a 72-pin version for 32-bit transfers and 144-, 200-, or 204-pin versions for 64-bit transfers. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig05">Figure 6.5</a> shows the difference between DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 SO-DIMMs.</p>

<p class="indent">Many netbooks cannot be upgraded. Many laptops have only one memory slot, so when you upgrade, you must replace the module that is installed. Laptops can also be upgraded with PC Cards or ExpressCards, but this type of upgrade is not as fast as the memory installed on the motherboard. Some smartphones can be upgraded with Flash memory cards. Tablets can sometimes have additional flash memory cards as well. Refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch01.html#ch01fig12">Figure 1.12</a> to see these.</p>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Planning the Memory InstallationâMemory Features</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In addition to determining what type of memory chips are going to be used, you must determine what features the memory chip might have. The computer system or motherboard documentation is going to delineate what features are supported. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab03">Table 6.3</a> helps characterize memory features.</p>

<p class="notepara">If a system uses even parity and the data bits 10000001 go into memory, the ninth bit, or parity bit, is a 0 because an even number of bits (2) are 1s. The parity changes to a 1 only when the number of bits in the data is an odd number of 1s. If the system uses even parity and the data bits 10000011 go into memory, the parity bit is a 1. There are only three 1s in the data bits. The parity bit adjusts the 1s to an even number. When checking data for accuracy, the parity method detects if one bit is incorrect. However, if 2 bits are in error, parity does not catch the error.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that some motherboards may support both non-parity and ECC (error correcting code) or may require a certain feature such as SPD (serial presence detect). It is important that you research this <em>before</em> you look to purchase memory.</p>
<p class="indent">A memory module may use more than one of the categories listed in the two previous tables. For example, a DIMM could be a DDR3 module, be registered, and support ECC for error detection. Most registered memory also uses the ECC technology. Memory modules can support either ECC or non-ECC as well as be registered or unbuffered as the type of technology.</p>
<p class="indent">Memory technology is moving quite quickly today. Chipsets also change constantly. Technicians are continually challenged to keep up with the features and abilities of the technology so that they can make recommendations to their customers. Trade magazines and the Internet are excellent resources for updates. Never forget to check the motherboardâs documentation when dealing with memory. Information is a technicianâs best friend.</p>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Planning for MemoryâThe Amount of Memory to Install</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you want to improve the performance of a computer, adding memory is one of the easiest upgrades. The amount of memory you need depends on what operating system you are using, what applications you are using, how many applications you want to have open at the same time, the type of computer you are using, and the maximum amount allowed by your motherboard. But first, we should look into memory capacities.</p>
<p class="indent">Think of a memory chip like a giant spreadsheet where each cell holds one bit. If you had 64 million cells, then the chip would hold 64 million bits. If each cell held 8 bits, then the chip would hold 64 million bytes, or 64MB. Capacities for DIMMs are 256MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB (and probably more before this book is revised).</p>
<p class="indent">Memory chips are sometimes shown with varying numbers. For example, a chip may be shown as 256MÃ64 and actually be a GB memory module. The 256MÃ64 is describing the memory chip in more detailâthere are 256 million locations with 64 bits in each location. 256 million times 64 is the chips capacity in mega<em>bits</em>. Divide by 8 and you get the chips capacity in <em>megabytes</em>. When parity or ECC is used with DIMMs, you see the second number as <em>72</em>; for example, 256MÃ72 is still GB. Those extra 8 bits are used for error checking. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab04">Table 6.4</a> shows sample memory configurations.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_210"></a>The operating system you use determines to a great extent the starting point for the amount of memory to have. Generally, the older or less powerful your operating system is, the smaller amount of RAM you need. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab05">Table 6.5</a> is the <em>starting point</em> for calculating memory requirements. Remember that as you want to run more applications simultaneously and the higher the application function (such as gaming or photo/video/sound manipulation), the more memory you will need. Also note that the memory recommendations shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab05">Table 6.5</a> are not the minimum requirements listed by the operating system creators.

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ How much memory you are starting with?</p>

<p class="noindent">A motherboard has a certain number of memory slots determined by the motherboard manufacturer. What type of memory module inserts into the slot and the features that the memory module can have are all determined by the motherboard manufacturer.</p>
<p class="indent">Most motherboards today support dual-channel memory. <strong><a id="ch06term12" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0283" class="pd_blue">Dual-channel</a></strong> means that the motherboard memory controller chip handles processing of memory requests more efficiently by handling two memory paths simultaneously. For example, say that a motherboard has four memory slots. Traditionally, the memory controller chip, commonly called the MCH or memory controller hub, had one channel through which all data from the four slots traveled. With dual-channeling, the four slots are divided into two channels with each channel having two slots each. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig08">Figure 6.8</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 6.8.</span> Dual-channel memory</p>
<p class="indent">Dual-channeling increases a systemâs performance. However, it speeds things up only if the memory modules match exactlyâsame memory type, same memory features, same speed, and same capacity. Note that on some motherboards, the memory modules on Channel A and Channel B do not have to be the same capacities, but the total capacity of the memory module in Channel A should match the total capacity of the memory modules installed in Channel B. Some motherboards require this. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a> illustrates this concept.</p>

<p class="notepara">Channel A and Channel B (sometimes labeled Channel 0 and Channel 1) should have matching memory modules. Buy a kit to ensure that the two modules are exactly the same.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_213"></a>Notice in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a> that in the first example, two identical memory modules are inserted. One memory module is in Channel A, and the other in Channel B. Motherboard manufacturers frequently require that the memory modules match in all respectsâmanufacturer, timing, and capacityâin order to support dual-channeling.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next example in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a>, three DIMMs are used. Some manufacturers support dual-channeling with three DIMMS, but you should always check the motherboard or system documentation to ensure that this is the case. Another example that is not shown in the figure is where an uneven amount of memory is installed in Channel A than in Channel Bâfor example, Channel A has 2GB, and Channel B has a 1GB memory module. Some motherboards can dual-channel for the first 1GB. Only if the motherboard supports this can dual-channeling be achieved this way.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_214"></a>In the last example shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a>, all four DIMMs are installed. Notice how the Channel A total capacity matches the Channel B total capacity (3GB in both channels, for a total of 6GB). When dual-channeling, buy memory modules in pairs from a single source. Memory vendors sell them this way.</p>

<p class="notepara">Do not install over 4GB on a computer with a 32-bit operating system such as 32-bit Windows. The operating system will not be able to see anything over 4GB. As a matter of fact, even when a system has 4GB installed, the 32-bit operating system shows the installed amount as slightly less than 4GB because some of that memory space is used for devices attached to the PCI/PCIe bus.</p>

<p class="indent">To plan for the correct amount of memory, you must refer to the motherboard documentation, and each motherboard is different. An example helps with this concept. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig10">Figure 6.10</a> shows a motherboard layout with four memory slots that has different labeling than shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig09">Figure 6.9</a>. Remember that motherboard manufacturers can label their motherboards any way they want. This is part of why the documentation is so important.</p>

<p class="noindent">The researching and buying step of planning for a memory installation/upgrade is the step most likely to make your head spin. Different websites list memory differently. Some give you too much information and some too little. A few, such as Kingston Technology (<a href="http://www.kingston.com/">http://www.kingston.com</a>) and Crucial (<a href="http://www.crucial.com/">http://www.crucial.com</a>), specialize in memory and make it as painless as possible. Nevertheless, as a technician, you should be familiar with all aspects of memory and memory advertisements.</p>
<p class="indent">A confusing aspect of buying memory is memory speed. Memory speed can be represented as ns (nanoseconds), MHz, or the DDR PC rating. <strong><a id="ch06term01" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0008" class="pd_blue">Access time</a></strong> describes how fast information goes into a memory chip or is removed from the chip and is measured in nanoseconds (ns). As for MHz or PC ratings, the higher the number is the faster the speed.</p>
<p class="indent">To understand memory, it is best to look at some examples. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab08">Table 6.8</a> shows sample memory advertisements.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch06tab08"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 6.8.</span> Sample DIMM advertisements</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 6. Memory_files/06tab08.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="280"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab08">Table 6.8</a> (as in most memory advertisements) that the memory capacity is shown first. The third advertisement down is a kit for a motherboard that has dual-channeling capabilities. It includes two 1GB memory modules, for a total of a 2GB memory gain. Also pay attention to the type of memory module that is being advertised. Notice in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab08">Table 6.8</a> that the first three memory modules are DDR3 and show the PC3 rating. The PC3 rating describes the maximum bandwidth of the module (transfers per second times eight). Later, the advertisement also shows the effective data transfer rate of 1333MHz or 1600MHz. You can multiply the data transfer rate by eight to see the bandwidth, which is sometimes the rounded number.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, look at the first module, which is a DDR3 1333MHz module. 1333 times eight equals 10664. You will see the PC3 rating as 10600. Some vendors add an E to the PC3 number to show an ECC module or a F or FB to the PC3 number to show that the module has the fully buffered feature.</p>

<p class="notepara">The lower the number of nanoseconds, the faster the access time of the memory chips. Think of access time like a track raceâthe person with the lowest time wins the race and is considered to be the fastest. Chips with lower access times (lower amount of nanoseconds or CL rating) are faster than those with higher access times (larger numbers).</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Another listing in the memory advertisement shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab08">Table 6.8</a> is the <strong><a id="ch06term03" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0139" class="pd_blue">CL rating</a></strong>. CL (column address strobe [CAS] latency), is the amount of time (clock cycles) that passes before the processor moves on to the next memory address. RAM is made up of cells where data is held. A cell is the intersection of a row and a column. Think of it as a spreadsheet application. The CAS signal picks which memory column to select, and a signal called RAS (row address strobe) picks which row to select. The intersection of the two is where the data is stored.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_217"></a>Motherboard manufacturers sometimes list a minimum CL or CAS latency value for memory modules. Motherboard documentation, memory magazine advertisements, and online memory retailers list the CL rating as a series of numbers, such as 3-1-1-1. The first number is the CL ratingâa CL3, in this example. The 3-1-1-1 is more detailed in that for a 32-bit transfer, it takes three clock cycles to send the first byte (8 bits), but the next 3 bytes are sent using one clock cycle each. In other words, it takes six clock cycles to transfer the 32 bits. Note that DDR3 CL ratings are higher, such as 9-9-9-24 or 11-11-11-28.</p>
<p class="indent">Also notice in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06tab08">Table 6.8</a> that memory features are listedâfully buffered, unbuffered, and registered. Be sure that the type of memory for which you planned is the type you are researching to buy. The voltage level for the memory module is shown (these are standard values), as is the capacity. With the capacity, if you see the number 64 at the end, the module does not use parity. If you see 72, the memory module uses either parity or ECC. The majority of the time, the 72 is for an ECC memory module.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Determine how much memory is needed. Ask users which operating system is installed and which applications they are using. Refer to documentation for each application to determine the amount of RAM recommended. Plan for growth.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Determine the capacity of the chips that go in each bank by drawing a diagram of the system, planning the memory population on paper, and referring to the documentation of the system or motherboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the type of motherboard, the number of banks available on the motherboard, whether the computer memory is being upgraded, and whether the memory is a new installation, some memory chips may need to be removed to put higher-capacity chips into the bank.

<p class="notepara">Before installing a memory module, power off the computer, disconnect the power cord from the back of the computer, and use proper antistatic procedures. Memory modules are especially susceptible to ESD. If ESD damages a memory module, a problem may not appear immediately and could be intermittent and hard to diagnose.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec11"><span class="pd_blue">Removing/Installing Memory</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When removing a DIMM or a RIMM and using proper ESD-prevention techniques, push down on the DIMM retaining tabs that clasp over the DIMM. Be careful not to overextend the tabs when pushing on them. If a plastic tab breaks, the only solution is to replace the motherboard. The DIMM/RIMM lifts slightly out of the socket. Always ensure you are grounded to prevent ESD by using an antistatic wrist strap or maintaining contact with metal with a bare part of your arm. Lift the module out of the socket once it is released. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig12">Figure 6.12</a> shows how to remove a DIMM/RIMM.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 6.12.</span> DIMM/RIMM removal</p>
<p class="indent">A DIMM/RIMM has one or more notches on the bottom where the gold or tin contacts are located. The DIMM inserts into the memory socket only one way. The DIMM memory socket has two tabs that align with the DIMM notches. Look at the DIMM and notice where the DIMM <a id="page_219"></a>notches are located. Look at the DIMM socket and notice where the tabs in the socket are located. The DIMM will not insert into the memory socket unless it is oriented properly.</p>
<p class="indent">A DIMM/RIMM is inserted straight down into the socket, not at a tilt like the SIMM or a SO-DIMM. Make sure the side tabs are pulled out before you insert the DIMM and close the tabs over the DIMM once it is firmly inserted into the socket. If the DIMM/RIMM does not go into the slot easily, do not force it and check the notch or notches for correct alignment. However, once the DIMM is aligned correctly into the slot, push the DIMM firmly into the slot and the tabs should naturally close over the DIMM or on the sides of the DIMM. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig13">Figure 6.13</a> illustrates how to insert a DIMM or a RIMM. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig14">Figure 6.14</a> shows a close-up of how the tab needs to fit securely in the memory module notch.</p>

<p class="indent">Todayâs motherboards automatically recognize new memory; however, some advanced BIOS options exist for tweaking memory performance. With some computers, the Setup program can be used to select parity, non-parity, or ECC options. Always refer to the motherboard or the computer system documentation.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_220"></a>Many laptops and netbooks have only one memory slot, so when you upgrade, you must remove the module that is installed. Always refer to the manufacturerâs documentation when doing this. Always turn off the laptop and remove the battery pack before upgrading memory. When installing memory into a mobile device, refer to the documentation to see if a retaining screw on the bottom of the unit must be removed or if the keyboard must be removed in order to access the memory slots. Be sure the laptop memory notch fits into the key in the memory slot. Laptop memory is normally installed at a 45-degree angle into the slot. Press down on the module until it locks into the side clips. The trick to installing memory is to push firmly into the slot and then into the side clamps. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig15">Figure 6.15</a> shows how to access the memory module in a laptop computer.

<p class="noindent">Each 8- or 16-bit application runs in an NT/2000/XP process called NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM). The NTVDM process simulates a 486 computer running DOS. Each older application runs in its own address space. However, 16-bit applications share address space in the NT environment. Many dated applications do not operate in the NT/2000/XP environment because these applications frequently make direct calls to hardware, which NT, 2000, and XP do not allow.</p>
<p class="indent">For Windows Vista and 7, Microsoft states that some older software might not run properly and offers the Compatibility mode tool. Right-click the application icon from the <em>Start</em> menu and select <em>Properties</em>.

<p class="noindent">You can get âout of memoryâ errors, POST code errors, motherboard diagnostic lights or codes, system slowdowns, and application locking due to memory problems with any operating system. With any of these problems, no matter which operating system is being used, check the amount of available memory and free space on the hard drive. Sometimes you must close all applications, reboot the computer, and open only the application that was running when the out of memory error occurred because some applications do not release the memory space they hold. The following tips and troubleshooting steps help with memory management:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Add more RAM. To see the amount of physical memory (RAM) currently installed, right-click the <em>My Computer</em> or <em>Computer</em> and select <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you just installed new memory and an error appears, this is normal. Enter Setup because the BIOS knows something has changed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you just installed new memory and the computer will not boot, check your installation by pushing harder on the memory module to ensure that it is fully seated into the slot. Check for loosened cables that you might have caused. Ensure that you are installing the right memory type. You might need to upgrade your BIOS so that your motherboard recognizes the increased amount of RAM.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the Vista/7 <strong><a id="ch06term42" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0576" class="pd_blue">Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool</a></strong>, using one of the following methods</p>

<p class="indent">If you receive a message that SPD device data is missing or inconclusive, your motherboard is looking for SPD data that it cannot receive from the memory module. If this is a new module, ensure that it supports SPD. If it is an older module, you need to replace one of your memory modules.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_226"></a>POST usually detects a problem with a memory chip, and most BIOS chips show an error code or message. The motherboard might also contain diagnostic lights or a code. If either occurs turn off the computer, remove the cover, and press down on any memory modules and reboot. Another option is to clean the memory module slots with compressed air and reinstall the module.</p>
<p class="indent">The key to good memory chip troubleshooting is to divide and conquer. Narrow the problem to a suspected memory module and then swap banks, if possible. Keep in mind that most memory problems are not in the hardware but in the software applications and operating system.</p>

<p class="indent">Various flash memory technologies that are used for storage applications have really advanced in the past few years. These technologies include CompactFlash, Secure Digital cards, MultiMediaCards (MMCs), xD cards, and Flash drives. <strong><a id="ch06term04" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0157" class="pd_blue">CompactFlash</a></strong> (CF) has two main standards: CompactFlash and CF+. CompactFlash is a small, 50-pin removable storage device that allows speeds up to 133MBps. The first CF device was introduced by the SanDisk Corporation. CF cards can store up to 137GB. The CF+ standard allows increased functionality with cards available for Ethernet, fax/modem/wireless, and barcode scanners.</p>
<p class="indent">CF cards can be inserted directly into many devices, such as cameras, smartphones, network devices, and tablet PCs. A CF card uses flash memory, which does not require a battery to keep the data saved to it. A CF card can also be installed into a computer with a PC Card/ExpressCard adapter or a CF card reader.</p>
<p class="indent">The CF technology is also used in solid-state drives. Sometimes called microdrives, these devices fit in a Type II (5mm) CF card slot. The Type I (3.3mm) slot is a common one included in cameras. Solid state drives are covered in more detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Memory is one of the most critical components of a computer, and it is important for a technician to be well versed in the different memory technologies. Because memory is one of the most common upgrades, becoming proficient and knowledgeable about populating memory is important. Lab exercises follow that help prepare you for the workforce and installing/upgrading memory.</p>
<h3 id="ch06lev1sec18"><a id="page_228"></a><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâTeamwork</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Technicians tend not to like working in teams as much as they like working on their own. Much of a technicianâs job is done solely. However, normally a technician has one or more peers, a supervisor, and a network of partners involved with the job such as suppliers, subcontractors, and part-time help. It is easy to have tunnel vision in a technical support job and lose sight of the mission of the business. Many technical jobs have the main purpose of generating revenueâsolving peopleâs computer and network problems for the purpose of making money. Other technicians have more of a back-office support roleâplanning, installing, configuring, maintaining, and troubleshooting technologies the business uses to make money.</p>
<p class="indent">Technicians must focus on solving the customerâs problems and ensuring that the customer feels his or her problem has been solved professionally and efficiently. However, you cannot lose sight of the business-first mentality; remember that you play a support role whether you generate revenue or not. You are a figure on someoneâs balance sheet, and you need to keep your skills and attitudes finely tuned to be valuable to the company. No matter how good you are at your job, you are still better to a company if you are part of a team than if youâre on your own. Being the person who is late, takes off early, chats too much with customers, blames others, and so on is not being a team member. If you are going to be late for work or leave early, inform your supervisor and co-workers so they can take care of any issues that arise. If you are going to be late for a customer appointment, contact them and let them know you are running late.</p>
<p class="indent">Technicians need to be good team players and see themselves as a reflection of their company when on the job. Teamwork is part of the skill set that employers seek as much as they want you to have technical skills. Think of ways that you can practice teamwork even as a student, and refine those skills when you join the workforce!</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Memory on a motherboard is SDRAM, a type of RAM that is cheaper and slower than SRAM, the type of memory inside the CPU and processor housing.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A DDR module fits in a DDR slot. A DDR2 module requires a DDR2 slot; a DDR3 module requires a DDR3 slot.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ RIMMs use RDRAM and were developed by Rambus, Inc. C-RIMMs are inserted into empty memory slots.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Unbuffered memory is the memory normally installed in computers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ ECC is used for error checking and is commonly found in high-end computers and servers. An older method of error checking was called parity.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The CL rating or the timing sequence first number shows how fast the processor can access data in sequential memory locations. The lower the first number, the faster the access.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SPD is a technology used so the memory module can communicate specifications to the BIOS.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Double-sided memory is one module that acts like two modules (not that it has chips on both sides even though it most likely does). A motherboard must support using double-sided modules.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Before installing memory, plan your strategy: read the manual to see the type of memory, determine the total amount of memory, determine if any memory is to be removed, determine the memory to purchase, and be mindful of getting the most out of your memory by implementing dual-, triple-, or even quadruple-channeling.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When implementing dual-, triple-, or quadruple-channeling, buy matching memory modules.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Any 32-bit operating system is limited to 4GB of memory.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Particular versions of Windows have memory limitations. For example, Windows 7 Starter edition is limited to 2GB, but any of the other Windows 7 versions can go to 4GB for the 32-bit versions. 64-bit version limitations are as follows: XP is 128GB. Vista/7 Home Basic is 8GB. Vista/7 Home Premium is 16GB. Vista higher versions are limited to 128GB. Windows 7 higher versions are limited to 192GB.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ RAM is very susceptible to ESD events. Use proper antistatic handling procedures, including using an antistatic wrist strap.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Before removing or installing memory, disconnect the power cord and remove the battery on a mobile device.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Laptops and netbooks can sometimes be upgraded with SO-DIMMs. Tablets and smartphones can sometimes be upgraded and have additional storage using flash memory cards.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Having as much RAM in the system as possible is an important performance factor. So is having free hard drive space because hard drive space is used as memory. This is called virtual memory, and the information stored temporarily on a hard drive is stored in an area known as a page file, paging file, or swap file. The swap file should be on the newest drive that has the most free storage.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use Task Manager to monitor memory performance.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use POST, motherboard LED/display output codes, BIOS diagnostics, and the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool to diagnose memory problems.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Flash media is used to provide memory or additional storage space for computing devices and includes USB flash drives, CF cards, and smaller cards, such as SD, microSD, miniSD, and xD.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A technician is part of a business and should contribute to the team. A technician should professionally represent a company.</p>
