<h3 id="ch14lev1sec1"><a id="page_728"></a><span class="pd_blue">Networking Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many networks are found all around us. The following are a few examples:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The network of roads and interstate highways</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The telephone network</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The electrical network that provides electricity to our homes</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The cellular network that allows cell phones/smartphones to connect to one another as well as connectivity between cell phones/smartphones and the wired telephone network and the Internet</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The air traffic control network</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Your network of friends and family</p>
<p class="indent">A network as it relates to computers is two or more devices that have the ability to communicate with one another and share resources. A network allows computer users to share files; communicate via email; browse the Internet; share a printer, modem, or scanner; and access applications and files. Networks can be divided into four major categories based on the size of the networkâPAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab01">Table 14.1</a> describes these different networks.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch14tab01"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 14.1.</span> Types of networks</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14tab01.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="750"></div>
<p class="indent">Today, networks are vital to businesses. They can also be found in many homes. A technician must have a basic understanding of the devices that make up networks and learn how to connect them to existing networks.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec2"><a id="page_729"></a><span class="pd_blue">Types of Local Area Networks</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are two basic types of LANs, a server-based network and a peer-to-peer network. With a server-based network, computer users log in to a main computer called a server where they are authenticated (authorized to use the network). The server is a more powerful computer than a normal workstation. The server contains information about who is allowed to connect to the network, and to what network resources (files, printer, and applications) the network user is allowed access. Another name for a server-based network is <strong><a id="ch14term09" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0144" class="pd_blue">client/server network</a></strong>. Windows computers in a server-based network are commonly called a <strong><a id="ch14term18" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0262" class="pd_blue">domain</a></strong>, or a Microsoft Active Directory domain. One or more dedicated servers log and track users and resources. Domains are commonly found in the business environment.</p>
<p class="indent">When working in a corporate environment, technicians commonly have to put new computers, replacement computers, or repaired computers on the domain. This requires special rights to be assigned to the technician; end users are not normally allowed to add computers to the domain. If a computer ever displays a message that the trust relationship is broken, the computer must be reconnected to the domain.</p>
<p class="indent">A peer-to-peer network does not have a centralized server. Instead, each computer is its own server and resources are shared between the workstation computers. The computer user sets up passwords to allow others access to the resources on or directly connected to that computer. A person uses the network to access remote files, printers, applications, and so forth from his/her own workstation. Server-based networks are more common in businesses, whereas peer-to-peer networks are more common in homes and very small businesses. A server-based network can consist of 10 or more computers; in contrast, a peer-to-peer network usually has fewer (2 to 9) computers.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows computers in a peer-to-peer network are known as a <strong><a id="ch14term83" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1095" class="pd_blue">workgroup</a></strong> or a homegroup. Two or more computers configured with the same workgroup name can share devices such as printers as well as files and folders. No central server or domain controller is used. Many homes and small businesses use a workgroup environment. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig01">Figure 14.1</a> shows the basic difference between the corporate domain environment (where there would be servers and lots of networking equipment) and the type of devices that would be in a home network or a workgroup.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch14fig01"></a><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="653" height="340"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.1.</span> Client/server environment versus workgroup environment</p>
<p class="indent">A server-based network is more secure than a peer-to-peer network. This is because the server is normally in a locked network room or wiring closet. Servers have a special operating system loaded on them called a NOS (network operating system), such as Microsoft Windows Server 2008 or Server 2012, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Sun Solaris. A network operating <a id="page_730"></a>system has utilities that allow computer user management (who is allowed onto the network), resource management (what network applications, files, printers, and so on a user can use), and security management (what a user is allowed to do with a resource such as read, write, and read and write). One user ID and password is all a remote user needs to access many network resources located throughout the business organization.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig02">Figure 14.2</a> shows how a server-based network can be configured. The network has one server in the center, four workstations, and two laser printers. The server has a database of usersâCSchmidt, RDevoid, and MElkinsâand their associated passwords. The server also has three applications loadedâMicrosoft Excel, Microsoft Project, and Microsoft Word. These applications and associated documents are stored on the server. Whether or not the users can access these applications and documents and what they can do within each document is also stored on the server. In the Permission column of the table located in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig02">Figure 14.2</a> is either R for Read or R/W for Read/Write. This is an indication of what the user can do in a particular application. For example, user CSchmidt has read and write access to Excel, Project, and Word. This means that she can open, look at, and modify documents in any of these three applications. MElkins can only read Excel and Word documents, but she can read and write Microsoft Project documents. CSchmidt can print to either of the laser printers, but RDevoid prints only to the LP1 laser printer.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.2.</span> Server-based network</p>
<p class="indent">A peer-to-peer network is not as expensive or as secure as a server-based network. A server is more expensive than a regular workstation, and it requires a network operating system. Since peer-to-peer networks do not use a dedicated server, costs are reduced. Instead of a network operating system, each workstation uses an operating system such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7. A peer-to-peer network is not as secure as a server-based network because each computer must be configured with individual user IDs and passwords. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig03">Figure 14.3</a> shows how a peer-to-peer network is configured.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.3.</span> Workgroup (peer-to-peer) network</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig03">Figure 14.3</a> shows three workstations, labeled Workstation 1, Workstation 2, and Workstation 3. Workstation 2 has a shared printer for everyone to use. There are three people in this company: Raina Devoid, Cheryl Schmidt, and Melodie Elkins. RDevoid normally works at Workstation 1 and she has shared a folder on the hard drive called <em>WORDDOCS</em> that has a password of Stealth2. CSchmidt and MElkins can access the documents located in <em>WORDDOCS</em> from their own workstations as long as they know the password is Stealth2. If RDevoid wants to access MElkinsâ <em>WAN</em> folder, RDevoid must know and remember that the password is Tech2001. If MElkinsâ changes the password on the <em>WAN</em> folder, MElkins must remember to tell the new password to anyone who needs access.

<p class="notepara">You can see that the more resources that are shared on a peer-to-peer network, the more passwords and the more cumbersome password management will be. That is the reason peer-to-peer networks are used in very small network environments.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">A peer-to-peer network password is only effective across the network. The password is not effective if someone sits down at the workstation. For example, if a summer intern, Ken Tinker, sits down at Workstation 3, Ken has full access to the <em>Inventory</em> folder and documents. Even though the folder is password protected for the peer-to-peer network, Ken is not using the network to access the folder so the password is useless. Ken could be prevented from accessing the folder if user IDs and passwords are implemented for individual machines. The problem of having access to a workstation and all its resources simply by sitting down at a computer is not as much of a threat today because of the newer operating systemsâ features.</p>
<p class="indent">Management of network resources is much harder to control on a peer-to-peer network than on a server-based network. Each user is required to manage the network resources on one computer and password management can become a nightmare. Remember with peer-to-peer networks that anyone who knows the password can access the folder across the network. Server-based networks are normally more secure because (1) passwords are managed centrally at the server and (2) the server is normally locked in a wiring closet or server room.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec4"><span class="pd_blue">Network Media Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Networks require some type of medium to transmit data. This medium is normally some type of cable or air. The most common types of cable are twisted-pair copper and fiber-optic, although some very old networks used coax cable and video networks use coax. Air is used in wireless networking where data is sent over radio frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">Copper Media</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The most common type of copper media used with computer networking is UTP (unshielded twisted-pair) cable. Most people are familiar with twisted-pair cable because this type of cable is used in homes for telephone wiring. Twisted-pair cable actually comes in two typesâshielded and unshielded. The acronyms used with this type of cable are <strong><a id="ch14term68" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0949" class="pd_blue">STP</a></strong> (shielded twisted-pair) and <strong><a id="ch14term78" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1048" class="pd_blue">UTP</a></strong> (unshielded twisted-pair). STP cable has extra foil shielding that provides more shielding. Shielded twisted-pair cable is used in industrial settings, such as a factory, where extra shielding is needed to prevent outside interference from interfering with the data on the cable.</p>
<p class="indent">Twisted-pair cable used with networking has eight copper wires. The wires are grouped in colored pairs. Each pair is twisted together to prevent crosstalk. Crosstalk occurs when a signal on one wire interferes with the signal on an adjacent wire. The wires are wrapped in a vinyl insulator. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig08">Figure 14.8</a> shows unshielded twisted-pair cable.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.8.</span> UTP cable</p>
<p class="indent">UTP cable is measured in gauges. The most common sizes of UTP cable are 22-, 23-, 24-, or 26-gauge unshielded twisted-pair cables. UTP cables come in different specifications called categories. The most common are categories 5e (which is an enhanced version of 5) and 6. People usually shorten the name Category 5 to CAT 5, CAT 5e, CAT 6, and so on. The categories determine, in part, how fast the network can run. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab03">Table 14.3</a> shows some of the categories of UTP cable.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_735"></a>A special type of UTP or STP cable is plenum cable. a Plenum is a buildingâs air circulation space for heating and air conditioning systems. <strong><a id="ch14term52" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0729" class="pd_blue">Plenum cable</a></strong> is treated with Teflon or alternative fire retardant materials so it is less of a fire risk.

<p class="indent">The alternative to plenum cable is <strong><a id="ch14term54" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0774" class="pd_blue">PVC</a></strong> (polyvinyl chloride) cable that has a plastic cable insulation or jacket. PVC is cheaper than plenum cable, but it can have flame-retardant added to make it flame-retardant if necessary to become compliant with building codes. PVC is usually easier to install than plenum cable.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to avoid extra troubleshooting time, most businesses install their network cable according to the ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A or 568-B standard. This standard specifies how far the cable can extend, how to label it, what type of jack to use, and so forth. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig09">Figure 14.9</a> illustrates the common RJ-45 cable standards used in industry.</p>

<p class="indent">New technicians commonly mistake an RJ-11 phone jack or connector with an RJ-45 network jack or connector. An RJ-11 connector has four conductors (wires), and an RJ-45 connector has eight conductors, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig11">Figure 14.11</a>, where the RJ-11 connector is on the left.</p>

<p class="indent">Fiber-optic cable has many advantages, including security, long-distance transmission, and bandwidth. Many government agencies use fiber-optic cable because of the high security it offers. Unlike signals from other cable media, light signals that travel down fiber are impossible to detect remotely. Also, because light is used instead of electrical signals, fiber-optic cable is not susceptible to interference from EMI- or RFI-producing devices. Fiber-optic cable is the most expensive cable type, but it also handles the most data with the least amount of data loss. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig15">Figure 14.15</a> shows fiber-optic cable.</p>

<p class="indent">Single-mode cable is classified by the size of the fiber core and the cladding. Common sizes include 8/125 to 10/125 microns. The first number represents the size of the core; the second number is the size of the cladding. Single-mode cable allows for distances over 50 miles (80,000 meters) at speeds over 100Gbps. Multi-mode cable (50/125 and 62.5/125 microns), on the other hand, can support distances over 1 mile (2,000 meters), with speeds up to 10Gbps.

<p class="noindent">Ethernet is the most common type of LAN, and more time must be spent on understanding it because technicians constantly add and remove devices from an Ethernet network. Some issues related to Ethernet include full-duplex and half-duplex transmissions, network slowdowns, and increasing bandwidth.</p>
<p class="indent">Ethernet networks were originally designed for <strong><a id="ch14term23" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0421" class="pd_blue">half-duplex</a></strong> (both directions, but only one direction at a time) transmission on a 10Mbps bus topology. The more workstations on the same network, the more collisions occur and the more the network slows down. In addition, with half-duplex Ethernet, less than 50 percent of the 10Mbps available bandwidth could be used because of collisions and the time it takes for a network frame to transmit across the wire.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: What does CSMA/CD mean to a network?</span></p>
<p class="notepara">CSMA/CD is the access method used with Ethernet networksâthe rules for how data gets on the network. The CS stands for âCarrier Sense,â which means that the PC checks the network cable for other traffic. MA, for âMultiple Access,â means that multiple computers can access the network cable simultaneously. CD, for âCollision Detection,â provides rules for what happens when computers access the network at the same time.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Todayâs Ethernet networks support speeds of 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1,000Mbps (1Gbps), and 10,000Mbps (10Gbps). Most Ethernet NICs are 10/100/1000, which means they can run at either 10, 100, or 1000Mbps using <strong><a id="ch14term22" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0397" class="pd_blue">full-duplex</a></strong> (transmit/receive simultaneously). <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab06">Table 14.6</a> lists the different types of Ethernet networks.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_742"></a>In the term 100BaseT, the 100 means that the network runs at 100Mbps. The T at the end of 100BaseT means that the computer uses twisted-pair cable. The 1000 in 1000BaseT means that 1000Mbps is supported. Base means that the network uses baseband technology. Baseband describes data that is sent over a single channel on a single wire. In contrast, broadband is used in cable TV systems and it allows multiple channels using different frequencies to be covered over a single wire.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Why full-duplex is better than half-duplex</span></p>
<p class="notepara">With full-duplex, collisions are not a problem because full-duplex takes advantage of the two cable pairs (one for receiving and one for transmitting). Full-duplex Ethernet creates a direct connection between the transmitting station at one end and the receiving circuits at the other end and allows 100 percent of the available bandwidth to be used in each direction.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Full-duplex more than doubles the amount of throughput on a network because of the lack of collisions and transmitting both directions simultaneously. Full-duplex is used when a switch is used to connect network devices together. Full-duplex connectivity uses four wires (two pairs). Two of the wires are used for sending data and the other two wires are used for receiving data. This creates a collision-free environment. Using a switch instead of a hub as a central connectivity device speeds up Ethernet transactions because a switch has more intelligence than a hub and creates a collision-free, full-duplex environment. Switches are very common devices in todayâs business network environment.</p>

<p class="notepara">When a workstation sends data to a hub, the hub broadcasts the data out all ports except for the port that originally transmits the data. A switch, on the other hand, keeps a table of addresses. When a switch receives data, the switch looks up the destination MAC address (an address burned into a NIC) in the switch table and forwards the data out the port for which it is destined.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec9"><span class="pd_blue">Network Standards</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers) committees create network standards called the 802 standards. Each standard is given an 802.x number and represents an area of networking. Standardization is good for the network industry because different manufacturersâ network components work with other manufacturersâ devices. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab07">Table 14.7</a> lists the various 802 standards.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14tab07.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="697"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_743"></a>For more information about the 802 standards, access the IEEE website, at <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.html">http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.html</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec10"><span class="pd_blue">The OSI Model</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a model for network communications known as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) model. The <strong><a id="ch14term49" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0673" class="pd_blue">OSI model</a></strong> is a standard for information transfer across the network. The model sets several guidelines, including (1) how the different transmission media are arranged and interconnected, (2) how network devices that use different languages communicate with one another, (3) how a network device goes about contacting another network device, (4) how and when data gets transmitted across the network, (5) how data is sent to the correct device, and (6) how it is known if the network data was received properly. All these tasks must be handled by a set of rules, and the OSI model provides a structure into which these rules fit.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you imagine a generic model for building a car? This model would state that you need some means of steering, a type of fuel to power the car, a place for the driver to sit, safety standards, and so forth. The model would not say what type of steering wheel to put in the car or what type of fuel the car must use, but is just a blueprint for making the car. The OSI model is a similar model in networking.</p>
<p class="indent">The OSI model divides networking into different layers so that it is easier to understand (and teach). Dividing the network into distinct layers also helps manufacturers. If a particular manufacturer wants to make a network device that works on Layer 3, the manufacturer only has to be concerned with Layer 3. This division helps networking technologies emerge much faster. Having a layered model also helps to teach network concepts. Each layer can be taught as a separate network function.</p>
<p class="indent">The layers of the OSI model (starting from the top and working down) are application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig20">Figure 14.20</a> shows this concept.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch14fig20"></a><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14fig20.jpg" alt="Image" width="199" height="283"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.20.</span> OSI model layers</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_744"></a>Each layer of the OSI model uses the layer below it (except for the physical layer, which is on the bottom). Each layer provides some function to the layer above it. For example, the data link layer cannot be accessed without first going through the physical layer. If communication needs to be performed at Layer 3 (the network layer), then the physical and data link layers must be used first.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: OSI mnemonic</span></p>
<p class="notepara">A mnemonic to help remember the OSI layers is: A Person Seldom Takes Naps During Parties. For example, <em>A</em> in the phrase is to remind you of the application layer. P in Person is to remind you of the presentation layer, and so on.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Each layer of the OSI model from the top down (except for the physical layer) adds information to the data being sent across the network. Sometimes this information is called a <em>header</em>. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig21">Figure 14.21</a> shows how a header is added as the packet travels down the OSI model. When the receiving computer receives the data, each layer removes the header information. Information at the physical layer is normally called <em>bits</em>. When referring to information at the data link layer, use the term <em>frame</em>. When referring to information at the network layer, use the term <em>packet</em>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.21.</span> OSI peer communication</p>
<p class="indent">Each of the seven OSI model layers performs a unique function and interacts with the layers surrounding it. The bottom three layers handle the physical delivery of data across the network. The top four layers handle the ins and outs of providing accurate data delivery between computers and their individual processes, especially in a multitasking operating system environment.</p>
<p class="indent">The OSI model is very confusing when you are first learning about networking, but it is very important. Understanding the model helps when troubleshooting a network. Knowing where the problem is occurring narrows the field of what the solution may be. For example, if a computer has problems communicating with a computer on the same network, then the problem is most likely a Layer 1 or a Layer 2 problem because Layer 3 takes care of communication between two networks. Therefore, a technician would check the cabling and NIC settings because they are Layer 1and 2 things that could be the issue. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab08">Table 14.8</a> summarizes the OSI model.</p>

A protocol suite is a group of protocols that are designed to work together. <strong><a id="ch14term73" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0980" class="pd_blue">TCP/IP</a></strong> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the protocol suite used in networks today. It is the most common network protocol and is required when accessing the Internet. Most companies (and homes) use TCP/IP as their standard protocol. The TCP/IP protocol suite consists of many protocols, including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), to name a few. The TCP/IP model describes how information flows through the computer when TCP/IP-based protocols are being used. The TCP/IP model has only four layers, in contrast to the seven layers in the theoretical OSI model. Because there are fewer layers and because the TCP/IP model is made up of protocols that are in production, it makes it easier to study and understand networking from a TCP/IP model prospective. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig22">Figure 14.22</a> shows the TCP/IP model, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab09">Table 14.9</a> describes the layers.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">Network Addressing</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Network adapters normally have two types of addresses assigned to themâa MAC address and an IP address. A MAC address is a 48-bit unique number that is burned into a ROM chip located on a NIC and is represented in hexadecimal. A MAC address is unique for every computer on the network. However, the MAC address has no scheme to it except that the first 24 bits represent the manufacturer. The MAC address is known as a Layer 2 address or a physical address. A MAC address is normally shown in one of the formats shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab11">Table 14.11</a>.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14tab11.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="174"></div>
<p class="indent">The IP address is a much more organized way of addressing a computer and it is sometimes known as a Layer 3 address, in reference to the OSI network layer. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (IP version 4) and IPv6 (IP version 6). <strong><a id="ch14term33" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0501" class="pd_blue">IPv4</a></strong> is the most common IP addressing used on LANs. The IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that is entered into a NICâs configuration parameters. This address is used when multiple networks are connected and when accessing the Internet. The IPv4 address is shown using dotted decimal notation, such as 192.168.10.4.</p>

<p class="notepara">An IPv4 address is separated into four sections called <em>oct</em>ets. Each number is separated by periods and represents 8 bits. The numbers that can be represented by 8 bits are 0 to 255.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch14term34" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0502" class="pd_blue">IPv6</a></strong> addresses are 128 bits in length and shown in hexadecimal format. IPv6 addresses are used by corporate devices and by some Internet service providers, and more conversions of IPv4 to IPv6 coming soon. An example of an IPv6 address is fe80::13e:4586:5807:95f7. Each set of four digits represents 16 bits. Anywhere there are just three digits, such as 13e, there is a zero in front that has been left off (013e). Anywhere there are double colons (::), a string of zeros has been omitted. Only one set of double colons is allowed in an IPv6 address. Many network cards are assigned IPv6 addresses, even if IPv6 is not being used.</p>
<p class="indent">One IPv6 address assigned to a NIC is a link-local address. An IPv6 link-local address is used to communicate on a particular network. This address cannot be used to communicate with devices on a different network. A link-local address can be manually assigned or more commonly, automatically assigned. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig23">Figure 14.23</a> shows a home computer that has an IPv6 link-local address that has been automatically assigned.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.23.</span> IPv6 link-local address</p>
<p class="indent">IPv4 addresses are grouped into five classes: Class A, B, C, D, and E. Class A, B, and C addresses are used by network devices. Class D addresses are used for multicasting (sending traffic to a group of devices such as in a distributed video or a web conference session), and Class E addresses are used for experimentation. It is easy to tell which type of IP address is being used by a device: All you have to look at is the first number shown in the dotted-decimal notation. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab12">Table 14.12</a> shows the classes of addresses.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_748"></a>If a computer has the IP address 12.150.172.39, the IP address is a Class A address because the first number is 12.

Addresses are also classified as public addresses and private addresses. A private address is used inside a home or business. This address is not allowed to be transmitted across the Internet. The service provider or company translates the address to a public address that is seen on Internet. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab13">Table 14.13</a> shows the private IP address ranges for each of the IPv4 classes.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec13"><span class="pd_blue">IP Addressing</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An IP address is broken into two major partsâthe network number and the host number. The <strong><a id="ch14term44" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0639" class="pd_blue">network number</a></strong> is the portion of an IP address that represents which network the computer is on. All computers on the same network have the same network number. The <strong><a id="ch14term24" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0443" class="pd_blue">host</a></strong> portion of an IP address represents the specific computer on the network. All computers on the same network have unique host numbers or they will not be able to communicate.</p>
<p class="indent">The number of bits that are used to represent the network number and the host number depends on which class of IP address is being used. With Class A IP addresses, the first 8 bits (the first number) represent the network portion, and the remaining 24 bits (the last three numbers) represent the host number. With Class B IP addresses, the first 16 bits (the first two numbers) represent the network portion, and the remaining 16 bits (the last two numbers) represent the host number. With Class C IP addresses, the first 24 bits (the first three numbers) represent the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits (the last number) represent the host number. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig24">Figure 14.24</a> illustrates this point.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch14fig24"></a><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14fig24.jpg" alt="Image" width="493" height="284"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.24.</span> IP addressing (network and host portions)</p>
<p class="indent">In order to see how IP addressing works, it is best to use an example. Say that a business has two networks connected with a router. On each network, there are computers and printers. Each of the two networks must have a unique network number. For this example, one network has the network number of 193.14.150.0, and the other network has the network number of 193.14.151.0. Notice how these numbers represent a Class C IP address because the first number is 193.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_749"></a>With a Class C IP address, the first three numbers represent the network number. The first network uses the numbers 193.14.150 to represent the network part of the IP address. The second network uses the numbers 193.14.151 in the network part of the address. Remember that each network has to have a different network part of the IP address than any other network in the organization. The last part of the IP address (the host portion) will be used to assign to each network device. On the first network, each device will have a number that starts with 193.14.150 because that is the network part of the number and it stays the same for all devices on that network. Each device will then have a different number in the last portion of the IP addressâfor example, 193.14.150.3, 193.14.150.4, and 193.14.150.5.</p>
<p class="indent">On the second network, each device will have a number that starts with 193.14.151 because that is the network part of the IP address. The last number in the IP address changes for each network deviceâfor example, 193.14.151.3, 193.14.151.4, 193.14.151.5, and so on. No device can have a host number of 0 because that number represents the network and no device can have a host number of 255 because that represents something called the broadcast address. A <strong><a id="ch14term06" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0098" class="pd_blue">broadcast address</a></strong> is the IP address used to communicate with all devices on a particular network.</p>
<p class="indent">In this example, no network device can be assigned the IP addresses 193.14.150.0 or 193.14.151.0 because these numbers represent the two networks. Furthermore, no network device can be assigned the IP addresses 193.14.150.255 or 193.14.151.255 because these numbers represent the broadcast address used with each network. An example of a Class B broadcast is 150.10.255.255. An example of a Class A broadcast is 11.255.255.255. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig25">Figure 14.25</a> shows this configuration.</p>

The same is true for the devices to the right of the router, except that they are on the 193.14.151.0 network.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to assigning a computer an IP address, you must also assign a subnet mask. The <strong><a id="ch14term70" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0954" class="pd_blue">subnet mask</a></strong> (sometimes shortened to <em>mask</em>) is a number that a computer uses to determine which part of the IP address represents the network and which portion represents the host. The default subnet mask for a Class A IP address is 255.0.0.0; the default subnet mask for a Class B IP address is 255.255.0.0; the default subnet mask for a Class C IP address is 255.255.255.0. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab14">Table 14.14</a> recaps this important information.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec14"><a id="page_750"></a><span class="pd_blue">Subnetting Basics</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In business, a subnet mask used does not usually correspond to the class of IP address being used. For example, at a college, the IP address 10.104.10.88 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 are assigned to a computer. The 10 in the first octet shows that this is a class A IP address with a default mask of 255.0.0.0. The 255 in the subnet mask is made up of eight 1s in binary in the first octet (11111111) followed by all 0s in the remaining octets (00000000.00000000.00000000).</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of the subnet mask is to tell you (and the network devices) what portion of the IP address is the network part. The rest of the address is the host portion of the address. The network part of any IP address is the same 1s and 0s for all computers on the network. The rest of the 1s and 0s can change and be unique addresses for the network devices on the same network.</p>
<p class="indent">The following important rules relate to subnetting:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The network number <em>cannot</em> be assigned to any device on the network.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The network number contains all 0s in the host portion of the address. Note that this does not mean that the number will be 0 in decimal. This is explained next.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The broadcast address (the number used to send a message to all devices on the network) <em>cannot</em> be assigned to any device on the network.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The broadcast address contains all 1s in the host portion of the address. Note that this does not mean that the number will be 255 in decimal.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the IP address and mask used as an example beforeâ10.104.10.88 and 255.255.255.0. Put these numbers in binary, one number on top of the other, to see the effects of the subnet mask:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0750fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="508" height="83"></div>
<p class="indent">The 1s in the subnet mask show which bits in the top row are the network part of the address. The subnet mask is always a row of consecutive 1s. Where the 1s stop is where the network portion of the address stops. Keep in mind that this does not have to be where an octet stops, as in this example. A good technique is to draw a line where the 1s in the subnet mask stop, as shown in the example that follows:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0750fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="508" height="121"></div>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Subnet mask in prefix notation</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Subnet masks in network documentation are commonly shown in prefix notation, using a slash with the number of consecutive 1s found in the subnet mask. For example, 10.104.10.88 255.255.255.0 is shown as 10.104.10.88/24, and 192.168.10.213/27 is the same as a 255.255.255.224 subnet mask.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">At this point, there is no other purpose for the subnet mask. You can get rid of it, as shown in the example that follows:</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_751"></a><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="508" height="86"></div>
<p class="indent">All 1s and 0s to the left of the drawn line are the network portion of the IP address. All devices on the same network will have this same combination of 1s and 0s up to the line. All 1s and 0s to the right of the drawn line are in the host portion of the IP address:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="503" height="111"></div>
<p class="indent">The network number, the IP address used to represent an entire single network, is found by setting all host bits to 0. The resulting number is the network number:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig03.jpg" alt="Image" width="503" height="112"></div>
<p class="indent">The network number for the network device that has the IP address 10.104.10.88 is 10.104.10.0. To find the broadcast address, the IP address used to send a message to all devices on the 10.104.10.0 network, set all the host bits to 1:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig04.jpg" alt="Image" width="503" height="111"></div>
<p class="indent">The broadcast IP address is 10.104.10.255 for the 10.104.10.0 network. This means that hosts can be assigned any addresses between the network number 10.104.10.0 and the broadcast address 10.104.10.255. Another way of stating this is that IP addresses 10.104.10.1 through 10.104.10.254 are usable IP addresses on the 10.104.10.0 network.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the IP address 192.168.10.213 and the subnet mask 255.255.255.224 assigned to a computer in a college. What would be the network number and broadcast address for this computer? To find the answer, write 192.168.10.213 in binary octets. Write the subnet mask in binary under the IP address:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig05.jpg" alt="Image" width="505" height="84"></div>
<p class="indent">Now draw a line where the 1s in the subnet mask stop:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0751fig06.jpg" alt="Image" width="506" height="104"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_752"></a>Remove the subnet mask because it is not needed anymore:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0752fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="504" height="65"></div>
<p class="indent">Set all host bits to 0 to find the network number:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0752fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="508" height="113"></div>
<p class="indent">The network number for the network device that has IP address 192.168.10.213 is 192.168.10.192. To find the broadcast address, set all host bits to 1. Set all host bits to 1 to find the broadcast address:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/0752fig03.jpg" alt="Image" width="508" height="115"></div>
<p class="indent">The broadcast address for the network device that has the IP address 192.168.10.213 is 192.168.10.223. Notice how all eight bits are used to calculate the number 223 in the last octet. Valid IP addresses are any numbers between the network number 192.168.10.192 and the broadcast IP address 192.168.10.223. In other words, the range of usable IP addresses is from 192.168.10.193 (one number larger than the network address) through 192.168.10.222 (one number less than the broadcast address). Practice problems in an exercise at the end of this chapter help you explore this concept.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wireless networks are networks that transmit data over air using either infrared (1 to 400THz range) or radio frequencies (2.4GHz or 5GHz range). Most wireless networks in homes and businesses use radio frequencies. Wireless networks operate at Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.</p>
<p class="indent">Wireless networks are very popular in home and business computer environments and are great in places that are not conducive to having cabling, such as outdoor centers, convention centers, bookstores, coffee shops, and hotels, as well as between buildings and in between nonwired rooms in homes or businesses. Wireless networks can be installed indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p class="notepara">Desktop workstations usually have integrated RJ-45 Ethernet connections, but if wireless networking is desired, then a wireless NIC usually has to be added.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Laptops and portable devices are frequently used to connect to wireless networks and have wireless capabilities integrated into them. Laptops also normally have wired network connections. A technician must be familiar with installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of both wired and wireless technologies.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec16"><a id="page_753"></a><span class="pd_blue">Bluetooth</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Bluetooth is a wireless technology for PANs. Bluetooth devices include PDAs (personal digital assistants), audio/visual products, automotive accessories, keyboards, mice, phones, printer adapters, cameras, wireless cell phone headsets, sunglasses with radios and wireless speakers, and other small wireless devices. Bluetooth works in the 2.4GHz range, similarly to business wireless networks, has three classes of devices (1, 2, and 3) that have a range of approximately 20 feet (6 meters), 72 feet (22 meters), and 328 feet (100 meters), respectively, and a maximum transfer rate of 24Mbps. Bluetooth supports both data and voice transmissions. Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected in a piconet (a small network). Bluetooth has always had security features integrated into it, including 128-bit encryption (scrambling of data, as discussed later in this chapter) that uses a modified form of SAFER+ (Secure and Fast Encryption Routine). Bluetooth is a very viable network solution for short-range wireless solutions. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig26">Figure 14.26</a> shows a Bluetooth cell phone headset.</p>

<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 support Bluetooth better than Windows XP. With Windows XP, when you connect a Bluetooth adapter to the computer, it should work if Windows XP Service Pack 2 or higher has been installed. If the Bluetooth adapter is one that Windows XP does not recognize, Windows XP may provide generic software support.</p>

<p class="indent">What is really important about channel IDs is that each access point must have a different frequency or nonoverlapping channel ID. Channel IDs should be selected at least five channel numbers apart so they do not interfere with one another. The wireless devices that connect to an access point have the same frequency setting as the access point. For most devices, this is an automatic detection feature.</p>
<p class="indent">The three commonly used nonoverlapping channel IDs are 1, 6, and 11. By using these three channel IDs, the three access points would not interfere with one another. This is because each center frequency overlaps with the adjacent frequency channels. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig34">Figure 14.34</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="indent">Some access points can be configured as a repeater to extend the coverage area of the wireless network. In this instance, the access point cannot normally be connected to the wired LAN. Instead, the repeater access point attaches to a ârootâ access point. The repeater access point allows wireless devices to communicate with it and relays the data to the other access point. Both access points will have the same SSID. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig37">Figure 14.37</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wireless cards and access points can have either external antennas or antennas built into them. An antenna is used to radiate or receive radio waves. Some access points also have integrated antennas. Wireless NICs and access points can also have detachable antennas depending on the make and model. With external antennas, you can simply move the antenna to a different angle to obtain a better connection. With some laptops, you must turn the laptop to a different angle to attach to an access point or have a stronger signal strength (which means faster transfers). Antenna placement is important in a wireless network.</p>

<p class="notepara">For laptops that have integrated wireless NICs, the wireless antenna is usually built into the laptop display for best connectivity. This is because the display is the tallest point of the laptop and therefore closest to the wireless receiving antenna. The quality of these integrated antennas is diverse.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">There are two major categories of antennas: omnidirectional and directional. An <strong><a id="ch14term48" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0666" class="pd_blue">omnidirectional antenna</a></strong> radiates energy in all directions.

Each antenna has a specific radiation pattern. A radiation pattern (sometimes called a propagation pattern) is the direction(s) the radio frequency is sent or received. It is the coverage area for the antenna that is normally shown in a graphical representation in the antenna manufacturerâs specifications. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig39">Figure 14.39</a> shows the difference in radiation patterns between omnidirectional and directional antennas.</p>

<p class="indent">A wireless network installer must be familiar with an antennaâs radiation pattern so that the appropriate type of antenna can be chosen for the installation. As a signal is radiated from an antenna, some of the signal is lost. Attenuation is the amount of signal loss of a radio wave as it travels (is propagated) through air. Attenuation is sometimes called path loss. Attenuation is measured in decibels. The decibel is a value that represents a measure of the ratio between two signal levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_762"></a>Things that affect an antennaâs path loss are the distance between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna, what obstructions are between the two antennas, and how high the antenna is mounted. Another factor that affects wireless transmission is interference, including radio frequencies being transmitted using the same frequency range and external noises. Other wireless devices, wireless networks, cordless phones, and microwave ovens are common sources of interference.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: The higher the decibel rating, the better the signal</span></p>
<p class="notepara">As a wireless device is moved farther away from an access point or another wireless device, the more attenuation occurs. Walls, trees, obstacles, or other radio waves can cause attenuation. The type of radio antenna and the antenna gain also affect the signal strength.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">An important concept in relationship to antennas is gain, and in order to understand gain, an isotropic antenna must be discussed. An isotropic antenna is not real; it is an imaginary antenna that is perfect in that it theoretically transmits an equal amount of power in all directions. The omnidirectional radiation pattern shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig39">Figure 14.39</a> would be the pattern of an isotropic antenna.</p>

<p class="notepara">Antenna gain is the antennaâs output power in a particular direction compared to the output power produced in any direction by an isotropic or dipole antenna.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Antenna gain is measured in dBi, which is a measurement of decibels in relationship to an isotropic antenna. (The <em>i</em> is for isotropic.) Some antennas are shown with a measurement of dBd instead of dBi. This measurement is referenced to a dipole antenna. (The <em>d</em> at the end is for dipole.) 0 dBd equals 2.14 dBi. More gain means more coverage in a particular direction. Gain is actually logarithmic in nature.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Understanding gain</span></p>
<p class="notepara">A 3dB gain is twice the output power. 10dB is 10 times the power, 13dB is about 20 times the power, and 20dB is 100 times the power. Gain that is shown with a negative value means there is a power loss. For example, a â3dB gain means the power is halved.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Imagine a round balloon that is blown up. The balloon represents an isotropic radiation patternâit extends in all directions. Push down on the top of the balloon, and the balloon extends out more horizontally than it does vertically. Push on the side of the balloon, and the balloon extends more in one horizontal directional than the side being pushed. Now think of the balloonâs shape as an antennaâs radiation pattern. Antenna designers can change the radiation pattern of an antenna by changing the antennaâs length and shape, similarly to how a balloonâs looks can be changed by pushing on it in different directions. In this way, different antennas can be created to serve different purposes.</p>

To take such a survey, temporarily mount an access point. With a laptop that has a wireless NIC and site survey software, walk around the wireless network area to see the coverage range. Most vendors provide site survey software with their wireless NICs.</p>
<p class="indent">The site survey can also be conducted by double-clicking the network icon on the task bar. The signal strength is shown in the window that appears. Move the access point as necessary to avoid attenuation and obtain the largest area coverage. Radio waves are affected by obstructions such as walls, trees, rain, snow, fog, and buildings, so for a larger project the site survey may need to be done over a period of time.

<p class="indent">There are many different types of antennas, but four common ones are parabolic, Yagi, patch, and dipole. Parabolic antennas can come in either grid or dish type models, and they are usually used in outdoor environments. Parabolic dishes are used to provide the greatest distances in a wireless network. Parabolic dish antennas may not come with mounting hardware, so you should research whether additional hardware is needed before purchasing one. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig41">Figure 14.41</a> shows a parabolic dish antenna.</p>

Patch antennas can be mounted to a variety of surfaces including room columns or walls.</p>

<p class="noindent">The IEEE 802.11 committees define standards for wireless networks, and they can be quite confusing. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab17">Table 14.17</a> shows the current and proposed wireless network standards.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/14tab17.jpg" alt="Image" width="750" height="388"></div>
<p class="indent">802.11-based wireless networks use CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) as an access method. Network devices listen on the cable for conflicting traffic, as with CSMA/CD; however, with CSMA/CA, a workstation that wants to transmit data sends a jam signal onto the cable. The workstation then waits a small amount of time for all other workstations to hear the jam signal, and then the workstation begins transmission. If a collision occurs, the workstation does the same thing as CSMA/CDâthe workstation stops transmitting, waits a designated amount of time, and then retransmits.</p>
<p class="indent">Data transfer speed between the wireless NIC and an access point or another wireless device is automatically negotiated for the fastest transfer possible. The farther away from an access point a wireless device is located, the lower the speed. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig43">Figure 14.43</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="noindent">When you install a NIC in a computer, you must take four or more configuration steps before connecting to the network:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Determine that an appropriate slot, port, or integrated wireless NIC is available. For example, a NIC can be integrated into the motherboard, require a PCI/PCIe slot, a mini-PCI/PCIe slot, connect to a USB port, or insert into a laptop slot (ExpressCard or CF NICâa CompactFlash card that has an RJ-45 NIC port).</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Obtain and install the appropriate NIC driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Give the computer a unique name and optionally join a workgroup or domain.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Configure TCP/IP.</p>
<p class="indent">Other things could be required, depending on the network environment. For example, if the system is a peer-to-peer network, file and print sharing must be enabled. If a wireless network is being configured, the SSID and possibly the security parameters need to be entered. If TCP/IP is configured, some other configuration parameters may be necessary. Labs 14.1, 14.2, and 14.8 at the end of the chapter demonstrate these concepts.</p>

A DHCP server (software configured on a network server or router) contains a pool of IP addresses. When a network device has been configured for DHCP and it boots, the device sends out a request for an IP address. A DHCP server responds to this request and issues an IP address to the network device. DHCP makes IP addressing easier and keeps network devices from being assigned duplicate IP addresses.</p>

If you can connect to other computers on your local network, but you cannot reach the Internet or other networks, it is likely the DHCP server is down and Windows has automatically assigned an APIPA address. To determine if APIPA is configured, open a command prompt window and type <code>ipconfig /all</code>. If you see the words <em>Autoconfiguration Enabled Yes</em>, APIPA is turned on.

Default gateway addresses are important for network devices to communicate with network devices on other networks. The default gateway address is the IP address of the router that is directly connected to that immediate network. Keep in mind that the primary job of a router is to find the best path to another network.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_769"></a>Wireless NICs are very easy to install. The utilities that are provided with the NICs are quite sophisticated, but easy to use. Always follow the manufacturerâs instructions. All the screens and configuration utilities have the same type of information. Understanding what the configuration parameters means is important. The hardest part about configuring wireless NICs is obtaining the correct parameters before installation begins. Incorrectly inputting any one of the parameters will cause the wireless NIC not to associate with the access point or remote wireless device and not transmit. Planning is critical for these types of cards.</p>
<p class="indent">Both wired and wireless NICs have some optional parameters that can be manually configured. These options are presented in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab18">Table 14.18</a> and shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig49">Figure 14.49</a>.

<p class="noindent">Another type of wireless device that you might configure is a wireless broadband device. A wireless broadband device is normally a USB device, but some mobile devices have integrated broadband access. Software is normally installed by either a disc or from the device itself. The device commonly has a phone number/account number associated with the broadband card. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig50">Figure 14.50</a> shows the type of information provided for a wireless broadband USB device.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec22"><span class="pd_blue">Virtualization Network Issues</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you configure a computer for virtualization, part of that virtualization is a virtual NIC. One virtual NIC is normally standard in a virtual machine. More virtual NICs can be assigned. Each virtual NIC has its own MAC address and can have an IP address assigned. If more than one virtual machine is installed, each can communicate with the other machine based on the NIC settings configured. Furthermore, the virtual NIC can go through the real NIC and have Internet access in the virtual environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than go into all of different virtualization vendorsâ products, letâs examine VMware Workstationâs NIC settings. Other vendors have similar configurations. In VMware workstation, a NIC can be configured for bridged, NAT (network address translation), or host-only mode. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab19">Table 14.19</a> describes these modes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Many wireless access points have the ability to route. The router connects the wired network and the wireless network together. A router is also good to have so that DHCP can be provided for both the wired and the wireless networks and provide a firewall for network security. Firewalls are covered in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the parameters needed for wireless NIC configuration are also needed for access point installation. However, installing an access point is more involved because it is the central device of the wireless network. The following list helps with access point installation. The questions should be answered <em>before</em> the access point is installed. Some of the security options that follow are discussed in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>:</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ How will the access point be mounted? Is mounting hardware provided with the access point, or does extra equipment have to be purchased?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Where should the access point be mounted for best coverage of the wireless network area? Where should the antenna be placed or how should it be angled? Perform a site survey to see best performance. Temporarily mount the access point. With a laptop that has a wireless NIC and site survey software, walk around the wireless network area to see the coverage range. The site survey can also be conducted by double clicking the network icon on the task bar; the signal strength is shown in the window that appears. Move the access point as necessary to avoid attenuation and obtain the largest area coverage.</p>

<p class="indent">Wireless networking is an important and popular technology. Technicians today must be familiar with this technology as corporations and home users install these types of products. Because the technology is reasonably priced, many new technicians install their own wireless network for the experience. Enjoy this technology because more wireless technologies are evolving.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec24"><span class="pd_blue">Configuring a Networked Printer</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are three ways to network a printer:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Connect a printer to a port on a computer that is connected to the network and share the printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Set up a computer or device that is designated as a print server. Connect the print server to the network.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Connect a printer with a network connector installed directly on the network. Printers can also be password protected on the network. A networked printer is very common in todayâs home and business computing environments. Networking expensive printers such as laser printers and color printers is cost-effective.</p>

<p class="notepara">Whether installing a wired or wireless network printer, obtain IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, SSID, and security information before starting the installation.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_772"></a>A printer that is connected to a workstation can be shared across the network by enabling File and Print Sharing. An exercise at the end of this chapter explains how to do this.</p>
<p class="indent">With Microsoft operating systems, networked printers are much easier to configure than they used to be. To connect and use a networked printer, use the <em>Add Printer</em> Wizard. A prompt is available that asks whether the printer is local or networked. A local printer is one that is directly attached to the computer and a networked printer is one attached to another workstation, a print server, or directly connected to the network.</p>
<p class="indent">The steps for installing a wireless printer are similar to installing a wired network printer once the printer is attached to the wireless network. Before installing a wireless printer, you need to ensure a functional wireless network is in the area. You need to know the SSID and any security settings configured on the wireless network. Normally, wireless printers are configured using one of the following methods:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Install software that comes with the printer <em>before</em> connecting the printer. Then use the software to enter the wireless network SSID and optional security parameters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the controls on the front panel of the printer to configure the wireless settings.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use a USB connection to the printer until the wireless network configuration options are entered.</p>
<p class="indent">Gathering the wireless configuration information is mandatory before you configure any device, including printers for a wireless network.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec25"><span class="pd_blue">Network Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One way to troubleshoot a network is to determine how many devices are affected. For example, if only one computer cannot communicate across a network, it will be handled differently than if several (or all) computers on a network cannot communicate. If a network port is suspect, try another cable or use a loopback plug to test the port. The easiest way to determine how many devices are having trouble is by using a simple test. Since most computers use TCP/IP, one tool that can be used for testing is the <span class="EmpStrong"><a id="ch14term51" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0721" class="pd_blue">ping</a></span> command.</p>

<p class="notepara">The <code>ping</code> command can be used to determine if the network path is available, if there are delays along the path, and whether the remote network device is reachable. <code>ping</code> sends a packet to an IP destination (that you determine) and a reply is sent back from the destination device (when everything is working fine).</p>

<p class="notepara">If a <code>ping</code> is successful (that is, you get a message that a reply was received from 127.0.0.1 or ::1), then the TCP/IP protocol stack is working correctly on the NIC. If the <code>ping</code> responds with a No or a 100% packet loss error, TCP/IP is not properly installed or functioning correctly on that one workstation.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The <code>ping</code> command can be used to check connectivity all around the network. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig51">Figure 14.51</a> shows a sample network that is used to explain how <code>ping</code> is used to check various network points.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.51.</span> Sample network troubleshooting scenario</p>
<p class="indent">The network consists of various network devices, including two servers and two laser printers. The devices connect to one of two switches that are connected using the uplink port. This port allows two similar devices to be connected with a standard Ethernet cable or fiber cable. A router connects to the top switch and the router connects to the Internet.</p>
<p class="indent">The 195.16.10.3 workstation cannot access a file on Server2 (195.16.10.100). The first step in troubleshooting is to <code>ping</code> Server2. If this is successful, the problem is in Server2 or the file located on the server.</p>
<p class="indent">If the <code>ping</code> is unsuccessful, there is a problem somewhere between the workstation and the server or on the server. Ping another device that connects to the same switchâfrom workstation 195.16.10.3, <code>ping</code> Server1 (195.16.10.2). A successful <code>ping</code> tells you the connection between the 195.16.10.3 workstation and the switch is good, the switch is working, the cable connecting to Server1 is fine, and Server1 is functioning.</p>

<p class="indent">Now <code>ping</code> workstation 195.16.10.101 (a device other than the server on the remote switch). If the <code>ping</code> is successful, (1) the uplink cable is operational; (2) the second switch is operational; (3) the cable that connects workstation 195.16.10.101 to the switch is good; and (4) the 195.16.10.101 workstation has been successfully configured for TCP/IP. If the <code>ping</code> is unsuccessful, one of these four items is faulty. If the <code>ping</code> is successful, the problems could be the (1) Server2 cable, (2) switch port to which the server connects, (3) server NIC, (4) server configuration, or (5) file on Server2.</p>

The <code>tracert</code> command is used to display the path a packet takes through the network. The benefit of using the <code>tracert</code> command is that you can see where a fault is occurring in a larger network. You can also see the network latency. Network latency is the delay measured from source to destination.</p>
<p class="indent">The following list contains methods that can help with NIC troubleshooting:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ From a command prompt window, use <code>ping localhost</code> to test the NIC.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <code>ping</code> another device on the same network.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <code>ping</code> the default gateway.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <code>ping</code> a device on a remote network.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_775"></a>â¢ Use the <code>tracert</code> command to see if the fault is inside or outside the company.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the status light on the NIC to see if the physical connection is good. Different NICs have different colored lights, but the two most common colors used with status lights to indicate a good connection are green and orange. Some status lights indicate the speed at which the NIC is operating (10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1Gbps).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the status light on the hub or switch that is used to connect the workstation NIC to the network. Green is a common color for a good connection on these devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check cabling. Even though the status lights may indicate that the connection is good, the cabling can still be faulty.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Update the device driver by obtaining a newer one from the NIC manufacturer website.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the IP addressing used. Use the <code>ipconfig</code> command from a prompt to ensure the NIC has an IP address assigned. If you get a duplicate IP address error message, change the IP addressing to DHCP or another statically assigned (not used already) address.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If on laptop, ensure that the wireless NIC is enabled. Look for a button or a keystroke combination that re-enables the wireless antenna, as well as ensuring the NIC is not disabled in the <em>Network Connections</em> (XP) or <em>Network and Sharing Center</em> (Vista/7) <em>Control Panel</em> link &gt; <em>Change adapter settings</em> link.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If your network connection shows limited connectivity or you cannot reach the Internet at all, try rebooting the PC (because of a 169.254.x.x address) or the router (if in a home or small business network). If this is a wireless connection, check security settings, the wireless button that controls the wireless antenna, or a wireless <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 14. Introduction to Networking_files/fn.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="20"></span> key that toggles the wireless NIC. If wired, the cable could be an issue.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the network connection is intermittent or slow on a wireless connection, move closer to the AP, change position of the wireless device, or add another AP in the area to extend the wireless network. If on a wired connection, check cabling and duplex settings. Replace a hub with a switch.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec26"><span class="pd_blue">Network Printer Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">To begin troubleshooting a network printer, do all the things that are normally done when troubleshooting a local printer. Check the obvious things first. Does the printer have power? Is the printer online? Does the printer have paper? Are the printerâs connector(s) secured tightly? Is the correct printer driver loaded? If all of these normal troubleshooting steps check out correctly, the following list can help with networked printers:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Print a test page and see if the printerâs IP address outputs or see if the printer is labeled with its IP address. If so, <code>ping</code> the printerâs IP address to see if there is network connectivity between the computer and the printer. Use the <code>tracert</code> command to see if there is a complete network path to the printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the printerâs <em>Properties</em> page to see if the printer has been paused.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Cancel any print jobs in the print queue and resubmit the print job.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Reset the printer by powering it off and back on. If it connects to a print server device, reset it too.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the printer has never worked, try a different version of the print driver.</p>

<p class="noindent">To see the TCP/IP model in action, imagine opening a web browser with two separate windows: <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/">http://www.pearsoned.com</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a>. Two separate packages of data would be formed. For example, since HTTP data is being sent, HTTP will specify how the data is to be formatted at the application layer. So, web page 1 gets HTTP data at the application layer and moves down to the transport layer (inside the computer). At the transport layer, TCP is used for HTTP traffic, and TCP adds a source port number 51116 and a destination port number 80 as part of building the transport-layer header. All this HTTP and TCP information moves down to the Internet layer, where IP adds a source and destination IP address. Because Pearson Educationâs web server has the IP address 74.125.47.99, that is the destination IP address. The packet continues moving down the model to the network access layer, and because the LAN is an Ethernet LAN, a source MAC address and destination MAC address are added. The data and all the headers are placed onto the Ethernet cable and sent on their way. The same thing happens with the second web page, except that at the transport layer, TCP adds port number 51117 and destination port number 80.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Pearson Education web server delivers the web page to the computer, the data is, of course, from the web server, but the TCP port numbers are reversed. The web server places port number 80 as the source port number and port number 51116 as the destination port number. The source and destination IP addresses and MAC addresses are reversed as well. When the original computer gets the message, it knows which browser window generated port number 51116, and it places the Pearson Education information from the web server into the correct browser window. The same is true when the Google request comes back from the Google web server. TCP/IP-based protocols are required to send and receive data through the Internet. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab21">Table 14.21</a> shows some of the most popular protocols, a description, and the TCP/IP port number commonly used. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab22">Table 14.22</a> has some of the common protocols or network standards and the TCP/IP model layer at which they operate.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec29"><span class="pd_blue">Sharing</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you double-click the <em>My Network Places/Network</em> desktop icon, you can view other network devices by their assigned names. You can also view them by typing <code>nbtstat -n</code> at a command prompt. Knowing a network device name is important when accessing a network share across the network. A <strong><a id="ch14term46" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0641" class="pd_blue">network share</a></strong> is a folder or device that has been shared and is accessible from a remote computer.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_780"></a>The command prompt can also be used to access network shares by typing the computer name and the share name using the UNC (Universal Naming Convention). For example, a computer called <em>CSchmidt</em> has a network share called <em>TESTS</em>. By typing <code>\\CSchmidt\TESTS</code> at the command prompt, you can access the network share. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig54">Figure 14.54</a> shows the <em>Sharing</em> tab.</p>

<p class="indent">Windows 7 makes it easier to create a network at home with the HomeGroup option. Be aware, though, that Windows 7 Starter and Home Basic versions can join but not create a homegroup. To access the HomeGroup Wizard to create or join a network, click the <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>Network and Internet</em> link &gt; <em>HomeGroup</em>. Part of the process is to create a password that is used to add other computers to the homegroup. Another part of the configuration process is to determine what to share such as pictures, music, videos, documents, and printers. These particular libraries are then made available to other computers on the same network. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig56">Figure 14.56</a> shows the process for a computer to join a homegroup.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_782"></a>If Windows XP or Vista computers need to access information from a Windows 7 computer that is on a HomeGroup network, then access the <em>User</em> Control Panel link on the Windows 7 computer to create a new <em>Standard user</em> account. Then, from the XP or Vista computer, use Windows Explorer to access the <em>Network/My Network Places</em> option in the left panel. Double-click the Windows 7 computer that has the shared documents. Enter the username and password that was created on the Windows 7 computer. Double-click the <em>Users</em> share that appears in the window and all file and folders shared on the Windows 7 computer are accessible.</p>
<p class="indent">For corporate users, you commonly must use a domain username (a username that has been configured on a centralized server) and a domain password. The rights you have been given determine the network resources you are allowed to access. A common parameter that must be entered when logging into a domain or a corporate resources is a username and password. Commonly, the domain name must also be specified. If a company domain called GoBig had a user with the username JTech (who had the password 5tay-ouT), Joe Tech might be prompted for a username and password and have to type GoBig\JTech for the username because the DOMAIN\Username format specifies the domain and then the appropriate user ID, followed by the appropriate password in the password textbox.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec30"><span class="pd_blue">Email</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another common Internet software application is an email (electronic mail) application to send messages across the Internet. Microsoft Live Mail and Outlook are two examples. Another popular freeware email software program is Eudora Light. Many Internet providers also have their own email package.</p>
<p class="indent">When you send an email message to someone, your email client software formats the message and sends it to an email server. The email server has the following functions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Has a database of email accounts</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Stores messages (email) sent and received</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Communicates with other email servers</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Uses the DNS protocol to locate the other servers</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that a DNS server keeps a database of locations and can contact a higher-level DNS server if a location is unknown.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_783"></a>A technician must be familiar with troubleshooting browser and email applications.

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec31"><span class="pd_blue">Network Connectivity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most people are familiar with wired and wireless network, but there are many methods used to create a network, especially a network that gets you into a building. The type of connection, protocol, and settings that you configure on the remote computer depends on the company to which you are connecting. A connection protocol used with dial-up networking is PPP. PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is a connection-oriented Layer 2 protocol that encapsulates data for transmission over various connection types.</p>
<p class="indent">Before creating a remote connection, you should always determine what parameters are to be entered <em>before</em> starting the configuration. Contact the network administrator for exact details on how to configure the remote connection. If the connection is to the Internet via an ISP, detailed instructions are available on the ISPâs website and/or with the materials that come with the Internet package from the ISP.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many types of network connections. Businesses use various types of network connections leased from the local phone company or a provider. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab23">Table 14.23</a> shows the types of network connections and bandwidth.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec32"><a id="page_784"></a><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Network Connectivity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Mobile devices would be useless if they could not connect to a network. This section explores common network connectivity options, including 802.11-based wireless networks, cellular network, and GPS connectivity. Also, since a network is commonly used to get apps (applications) downloaded and installed on mobile devices, we explore network apps, device synchronization, and app configuration.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that because Android devices are created using an open source operating system, configuration options can be different from one device to another. By default, when most mobile devices are configured for wireless networks, the device will connect. If you walk out of range of that wireless network and another one is configured, the device will switch over to the second wireless network. If no wireless networks are within range, the mobile device will swap over to the cellular network if you are connected to the network. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab24">Table 14.24</a> has the basic connectivity configuration options for Android and Apple iOS devices. Note that Airplane mode disables all types of connectivity. In this mode, you could still view a movie or play a game without Internet, cellular, or wireless connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="ch14lev1sec33"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Apps</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Mobile devices most commonly use a wireless, cellular, or Bluetooth network to install apps from Google Play or Market, Appleâs App Store or iTunes, Amazonâs App Store, and a host of other content sources, but there are other ways to get an app: manually install (side load), use a USB cable (commonly requires a file management app), use your storage media and a media reader, use an app such as Bump to transfer an application (or photos), or through a QR (Quick Response) code between two devices (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14fig57">Figure 14.57</a>). Note that whatever method you use to install an app, you must ensure that the app is from a trusted source or a trusted app developer. Be sure to see what permissions are given when an app is installing. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14tab25">Table 14.25</a> shows tasks that are commonly done with apps.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_786"></a>Some apps have data that can be synchronized with other devices. Examples include the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Contacts</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Programs</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Email</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Photos</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Music</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Videos</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Files</p>
<p class="noindent">iTunes is used to synchronize data between Apple iOS devices and Windows computers. You can connect to iTunes using a wireless network or the cellular network. A USB cable can also be used to connect two devices and synchronize them.</p>
<p class="indent">iTunes can also be used to manage and restore iOS devices when they are registered (activated) with Apple. The version of iTunes requires the following hardware and software requirements (as of press date):</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 1GHz processor</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 512MB RAM</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows XP (SP2) or higher</p>
<p class="indent">iTunes has a 64-bit version for 64-bit Windows operating systems. There is no such application for Android devices. The individual app may support synchronization with Google. You can view and add apps by using the <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Personal</em> (which is not used on some Android devices) &gt; <em>Accounts and sync</em> or whatever method used by the particular application.</p>
<p class="indent">Because mobile devices have limited storage capacity compared to other computing devices, remote backup of data is important. Apple provides 5GB of free storage (at press time) with iCloud. You can use iCloud to back up things like your contacts, calendar, ringtones, photos/videos, and data. Google provides backup of the calendar, mail, and contacts. Other cloud storage vendors, such as Google, DropBox, and SugarSync, provide free cloud storage. There are apps provided to manage your backup. Some apps support cloud storage. With cloud storage, you can store your photos, images, files, app data, and so on, and your app will look to that storage (if you have configured it so) for the data.</p>
<p class="indent">Email configuration for a mobile device includes knowing quite a bit of technical information (as it does when you forward email from one application to another). An Android device comes with Gmail. If you have a Gmail account, you can use it to begin configuration of the phone or tablet. Otherwise, a Gmail account will be created. To configure an Android device for an email account, perform the following generic steps (keeping in mind the open source nature of Android):</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> At the home screen, tap the <em>Email</em> icon.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Enter an email address and password &gt; <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Select the type of account and enter the account specifics such as domain and server name &gt; <em>Next</em>.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Tap <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">A technician may be required to configure mobile devices for corporate users. Part of the email configuration might include protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, POP3, and SSL, as well as the associated protocol port numbers used on the companyâs servers. A technician would have to obtain this information from the network staff.</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec34"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâBeing Proactive</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A good technician is proactive, which means that the technician thinks of ways to improve a situation and anticipates problems and fixes them before being told to. A proactive technician follows up after a service call to ensure that a repair fixed the problem rather than waiting for another help desk ticket that states that the problem is unresolved. When something like a theft or a problem with a customer occurs, a proactive technician provides a list of recommended solutions or procedural changes to the supervisor rather than waits for the supervisor to delineate what changes must occur.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, consider a technician at a college. The technician is responsible for any problems logged by computer users through the help desk. The technician is also responsible for maintaining the computer classrooms used by various departments. Each term, the technician reloads the computers with software updates and changes requested by the teachers. A proactive technician checks each machine and ensures that the computer boots properly and that the load is successful. The technician does not wait for the first day of the term or for a teacher to report a problem to the help desk.</p>
<p class="indent">Another example involves checking new software. When the computers are reloaded each term, a faculty member is asked to check the load. A proactive technician has a list of âstandardâ software loaded on the computer such as the operating system, service pack level, and any applications that are standard throughout the college. A separate list would include the changes that were applied to the computer. Then the faculty member can simply look at the list and verify the load. Being proactive actually saves the technician and the faculty member time each term.</p>
<p class="indent">The opposite of being proactive is being reactive. A reactive technician responds to situations only when there is a problem. The technician is not looking for ways to avoid problems. For example, a proactive technician ensures a computer is configured for automatic updates of virus scanning software. A reactive technician waits until a help desk ticket is created for a computer that exhibits unusual behavior (it has a virus).</p>
<p class="indent">As a student, practice being proactive with your life. Start an assignment a day before you would normally start it. Talk to your teacher about your grade in advance (before the day preceding the final). Bring a pencil and paper to school (donât wait until you arrive at school to realize that you donât have them and have to borrow from someone).</p>
<h3 id="ch14lev1sec35"><a id="page_788"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Networks are created to share data and devices and connect to the Internet. Types of networks include PANs, LANs, MANs, and WANs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Networks can be wired or wireless. Wired networks use copper (UTP, STP, and coaxial) or fiber-optic media.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A peer-to-peer network is composed of a small number of computers, whereas the client/server type of network is used in companies in a domain environment. A domain environment has a server that provides authentication to resources with a centralized user ID and password. A peer-to-peer network manages the usernames on a computer-by-computer basis, which is grows less secure and more difficult to manage as the network grows.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ethernet is the most common type of LAN, and it is wired in a star or extended star topology. A hub or switch is used to connect the devices. Each network connects to a router for communication with other networks. The routerâs IP address is the default gateway for all network devices on a particular LAN.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Computers must have IP addresses to participate in a TCP/IP-based network (and gain access to the Internet). IPv4 is the most common addressing used on computers today, but IPv6 addresses are slowly being assigned and used by corporate devices and Internet providers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ IP addresses are grouped by classes, with a particular subnet mask for each class. Each default mask can be changed to further subdivide a network for more efficient and manageable addressing. DHCP can be used to provide addresses to network devices or a static address can be assigned. Public addresses are routable on the Internet. Private addresses are used within homes and companies. These addresses can be translated using NAT/PAT to public addresses.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that includes the following important ones: FTP, Telnet, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, IMAP, RDP, DNS, LDAP, SNMP, SSH, SFTP, TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The OSI model is a theoretical model with seven layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. The TCP/IP model is a working model and contains four layers: application, transport, internet (internetwork), and network access. Common application protocols include TFTP, FTP, SFTP, Telnet, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, LDAP, DNS, SNMP, and SSH. The device and applications that work at Layer 3 (network or internet layers) include a router, IP, and ICMP. The devices and applications that work at Layer 2 (data link or network access) include a switch, access point, and ARP. Keep in mind that Ethernet has Layer 2 specifications. That is why a MAC address is a Layer 2 address. The devices that work at Layer 1 (physical or network access) are cable, connectors, hubs, and wireless antennas.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 802.11 and Bluetooth are types of wireless networks. Bluetooth is used in PANs, and 802.11 is used in wireless LANs. 802.11 wireless NICs include 802.11a, b, g, and n. 802.11a and n work in the 5GHz range; 802.11b, g, and n work in the 2.4GHz range. 802.11 antennas are either directional or omnidirectional.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The key tools for troubleshooting a networked computer are the <code>ipconfig</code>, <code>ping</code>, <code>nslookup</code>, <code>tracert</code> commands, and a cable tester.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ To configure email on any device, you need to know certain parameters, such as the protocol used, the application used, the username, the password, the domain, SSL settings, and port numbers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Mobile devices are commonly configured for Bluetooth, cellular, and 802.11-based networks, and apps are installed using the networks. Some items are automatically backed up by Google for Android devices and Apple iCloud for iOS devices. iTunes is used to synchronize and update Apple iOS photos, music, movies, and operating systems.</p>

<p class="procedure"><em>Procedure</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the following procedure and answer the accompanying questions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_793"></a><strong>1.</strong> Category 5 UTP cable consists of four twisted pairs of wires, color coded for easy identification. The color-coded wires are colored as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Pair 1: White/orange and orange</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Pair 2: White/blue and blue</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Pair 3: White/green and green</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Pair 4: White/brown and brown</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Using the stripper/crimper tool, strip approximately 1/2 inch (1 centimeter) of the protective outer sheath to expose the four twisted pairs of wires. Most strippers have a strip gauge to ensure stripping the proper length.

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 14.59.</span> Strip the cable sheathing</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><em>Note</em>: In order to make it easier to sort the wire pairs, the sheathing can be stripped farther than 1/2 inch (1 centimeter), and the wires can be sorted properly and trimmed to the proper length.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Untwist the exposed wire pairs. Be careful that you do not remove more twist than necessary. Sort the wires according to the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 1: White/orange</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 2: Orange</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 3: White/green</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 4: Blue</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 5: White/blue</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 6: Green</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 7: White/brown</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Wire 8: Brown</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP">Ethernet cable utilizes wires 1, 2, 3, and 6. Using the above wiring scheme means that the cable will use the white/orange-orange and white/green-green wire pairs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">Will both ends of the cable need to follow the same wiring schematic?</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Insert the sorted and trimmed cable into an RJ-45 connector. The RJ-45 connector key (tang) should face downward with the open end toward you while you insert the wires. Verify that all eight wires fully insert into the RJ-45 connector and that they are inserted in the proper order.

<p class="enter">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> Before using the cable, it should be tested with a cable tester to verify that you have end-to-end continuity on individual wires and proper continuity between wire pairs. Insert the RJ-45 connector into the proper cable tester receptacle and verify that the cable is functional.

<p class="notes1"><em>Note</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal situations, straight-through UTP cable is used to connect to a central hub or switch. In this exercise, you create a crossover cable for use when directly connecting two network devices (computers <em>without</em> using a central hub or switch).</p>
<p class="procedure"><em>Procedure</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the following procedure and answer the accompanying questions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Category 5 UTP cable consists of four twisted pairs of wires that are color coded for easy identification. The color-coded wires are as follows:</p>
