<h3 id="ch04lev1sec1"><a id="page_120"></a><span class="pd_blue">Disassembly Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is seldom necessary to completely disassemble a computer. However, when a technician is first learning about PCs, disassembly can be both informative and fun. Technicians might disassemble parts of a computer to perform preventive cleaning or to troubleshoot a problem. It may also be appropriate to disassemble a computer when it has a problem of undetermined cause. Sometimes, the only way to diagnose a problem is to disassemble the computer outside the case or remove components one by one. Disassembling a computer outside the case may help with grounding problems. A <strong><a id="ch04term20" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0416" class="pd_blue">grounding</a></strong> problem occurs when the motherboard or adapter is not properly installed and a trace (a metal line on the motherboard or adapter) touches the computer frame, causing the adapter and possibly other components to stop working. Donât forget to remove jewelry and use proper lifting techniques, as described in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch01.html#ch01fig01">Figure 1.1</a> (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>) before disassembling a computer.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec2"><span class="pd_blue">Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">You must take many precautions when disassembling a computer. The electronic circuits located on the motherboard and adapters are subject to ESD. <strong><a id="ch04term19" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0333" class="pd_blue">ESD</a></strong> (electrostatic discharge) is a difference of potential between two items that causes static electricity. Static electricity can damage electronic equipment without the technicianâs knowledge. The average person requires a static discharge of 3,000 volts before he or she feels it. An electronic component can be damaged with as little as 30 volts. Some electronic components may not be damaged the first time static electricity occurs. However, the effects of static electricity can be cumulative, weakening or eventually destroying a component. An ESD event is not recoverableânothing can be done about the damage it induces. Electronic chips and memory modules are most susceptible to ESD strikes.</p>
<p class="indent">Atmospheric conditions affect static electricity. When humidity is low, the potential for ESD is greater than at any other time; however, too much humidity is bad for electronics. Keep humidity between 45 and 55 percent to reduce the threat of ESD.</p>
<p class="indent">A technician can prevent ESD by using a variety of methods. The most common tactic is to use an <strong><a id="ch04term05" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0036" class="pd_blue">antistatic wrist strap</a></strong>. One end encircles the technicianâs wrist. At the other end, an alligator clip attaches to the computer. The clip attaches to a grounding post or a metal part such as the power supply. The electronic symbol for ground follows:</p>
<div class="image2"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/120fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="98" height="41"></div>
<p class="indent">An antistatic wrist strap allows the technician and the computer to be at the same voltage potential. As long as the technician and the computer or electronic part are at the same potential, static electricity does not occur. An exercise at the end of the chapter demonstrates how to attach an antistatic wrist strap and how to perform maintenance on it. Technicians should use an ESD wrist strap whenever possible.</p>
<p class="indent">A resistor inside an antistatic wrist strap protects the technician in case something accidentally touches the ground to which the strap attaches while he or she is working inside a computer. This resistor cannot protect the technician against the possible voltages inside a monitor. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig01">Figure 4.1</a> for an illustration of an antistatic wrist strap. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig02">Figure 4.2</a> shows a good location for attaching an antistatic wrist strap.</p>

<p class="notepara">Technicians should not wear an ESD wrist strap when working inside a CRT monitor because of the high voltages there.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>Antistatic bags are good for storing spare adapters and motherboards when the parts are not in use. However, antistatic bags lose their effectiveness after a few years. Antistatic mats are available to place underneath a computer being repaired; such a mat may have a snap for connecting the antistatic wrist strap. Antistatic heel straps are also available.</p>
<p class="indent">If an antistatic wrist strap is not available, you can still reduce the chance of ESD damage. After removing the computer case, stay attached to an unpainted metal computer part. One such part is the power supply. If you are right-handed, place your bare left arm on the power supply. Remove the computer parts one by one, always keeping your left elbow (or some other bare part of your arm) connected to the power supply. If you are left-handed, place your right arm on the power supply. By placing your elbow on the power supply, both hands are free to remove computer parts. This method is an effective way of keeping the technician and the computer at the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of ESD damage. It is not as safe as using an antistatic wrist strap. Also, removing the power cable from the back of the <a id="page_122"></a>computer is a good idea. A power supply provides a small amount of power to the motherboard even when the computer is powered off. Always unplug the computer and use an antistatic wrist strap when removing or replacing parts inside a computer!</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec3"><span class="pd_blue">EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong><a id="ch04term17" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0319" class="pd_blue">EMI</a></strong> (electromagnetic interference, sometimes called EMR, for electromagnetic radiation) is noise caused by electrical devices. Many devices can cause EMI, such as a computer, a pencil sharpener, a motor, a vacuum cleaner, an air conditioner, and fluorescent lighting. The electrical devices around the computer case, including a CRT-type monitor and speakers, cause more problems than the computer.</p>
<p class="indent">A specific type of electromagnetic interference that affects computers is <strong><a id="ch04term36" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0820" class="pd_blue">RFI</a></strong> (radio frequency interference). RFI is simply those noises that occur in the radio frequency range. Anytime a computer has an intermittent problem, check the surrounding devices for the source of that problem. For example, if the computer goes down only when the pencil sharpener operates or when using the optical drive, EMI could be to blame. EMI problems are very hard to track to the source. Any electronic device including computers and printers can be a source of EMI/RFI. EMI/RFI can affect any electronic circuit. EMI can also come through power lines. Move the computer to a different wall outlet or to a totally different circuit to determine if the power outlet is the problem source. EMI can also affect files on a hard drive.</p>

<p class="notepara">To help with EMI and RFI problems, replace slot covers for expansion slots that are no longer being used. Slot covers also keep out dust and improve the air flow within the case.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec4"><span class="pd_blue">Disassembly</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Before a technician disassembles a computer, several steps should be performed or considered. The following disassembly tips are helpful:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not remove the motherboard battery, or the configuration information in CMOS will be lost.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use proper grounding procedures to prevent ESD damage.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Keep paper, a pen, a phone, and a digital camera nearby for note taking, diagramming, and photo taking. Even if you have taken apart computers for years, you might find something unique or different inside this one.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have ample flat and clean workspace.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When removing adapters, do not stack the adapters on top of one another.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If possible, place removed adapters inside a special ESD protective bag.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Handle each adapter, motherboard, or processor on the side edges. Avoid touching the gold contacts on the bottom of adapters. Sweat, oil, and dirt cause problems.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remember that hard drives require careful handling. A very small jolt can cause damage to stored data.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ You can remove a power supply, but do not disassemble a CRT-style monitor or power supply without proper training and tools.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Document screw and cable locations. Label them if possible.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">Tools</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">No chapter on disassembly and reassembly is complete without mentioning tools. Tools can be divided into two categories: (1) those you should not leave the office without and (2) those that are nice to have in the office, at home, or in the car.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123"></a>Many technicians do not go on a repair call with a full tool case. Ninety-five percent of all repairs are completed with the following basic tools:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Small and medium flat-tipped screwdrivers</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ #0, #1, and #2 Phillips screwdrivers</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 1/4- and 3/16-inch hex nut drivers</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Small diagonal cutters</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Needlenose pliers</p>
<p class="indent">Screwdrivers take care of most disassemblies and reassemblies. Sometimes manufacturers place tie wraps on new parts, new cables, or the cables inside the computer case. The diagonal cutters are great for removing the tie wraps without cutting cables or damaging parts. Needlenose pliers are good for straightening bent pins on cables or connectors, and doing a million other things. Small tweaker screwdrivers and needlenose pliers are indispensable.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Do not use magnetized screwdrivers</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Avoid using a magnetic screwdriver when working on a computer. It can cause permanent loss of data on hard drives or floppy disks. Magnetism can also induce currents into components and damage them. Sometimes, technicians are tempted to use a magnetic screwdriver when they drop a small part such as a screw into a hard-to-reach place, but avoid using a magnetic screwdriver.</p>

<p class="indent">Many technicians start with a basic $15 microcomputer repair kit and build from there. A bargain table 6-in-1 or 4-in-1 combination screwdriver that has two sizes of flat-tipped and two sizes of Phillips screwdrivers is a common tool among new technicians. A specialized Swiss army knife with screwdrivers is the favorite of some technicians. Other technicians prefer to carry an all-in-one tool in a pouch that connects to their belt.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatives to the magnetic screwdriver include a screw pick-up tool and common sense. A screw pick-up tool is used in hard-to-reach places and sometimes under the motherboard. If a screw rolls under the motherboard and cannot be reached, tilt the computer so that the screw rolls out. Sometimes the case must be tilted in different directions until the screw becomes dislodged.</p>
<p class="indent">There are tools that no one thinks of as tools but that should be taken on a service call every time. They include a pen or pencil with which to take notes and fill out the repair slip and a bootable disc containing the technicianâs favorite repair utilities. Usually a technician has several bootable discs for different operating systems and utilities. Often a flashlight comes in handy because some rooms and offices are dimly lit. Finally, do not forget to bring a smile and a sense of humor.</p>

<p class="indent">You could get some nice muscle tone from carrying all these nice-to-have but normally unnecessary tools. When starting out in computer repair, get the basics. As your career path and skill level grow, so will your tool kit. Getting to a job site and not having the right tool can be a real hassle. However, because there are no standards or limitations on what manufacturers can use in their product lines, it is impossible to always have the right tool on hand. However, always remember that no tool kit is complete without an antistatic wrist strap.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Opening the Case</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Opening or removing the case is sometimes the hardest part of disassembly. Some manufacturers have tabs or covers over the retaining screws, and others have retention levers or tabs that have to be depressed before the cover slides open or away. For some computers you must press a tab on top of the computer downward while simultaneously pressing upward on a tab on the bottom of the computer. Once the tabs are pressed, the cover can be pried open. Sound like a two-person job? Sometimes it is.</p>
<p class="indent">Some cases have screws that loosen but do not have to be removed all the way to remove or open the case. For all computer screws, make diagrams and use an egg carton and label each section of the carton with where you got the screws. When possible, refer to the manufacturerâs directions when opening a case.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Cables and Connectors</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Internal cables commonly connect from a device to the motherboard, the power supply to a device, the motherboard to the front panel buttons or ports, and/or from a card that occupies an expansion space to the motherboard. Cables can be tricky. Inserting a cable backward into a device or adapter can damage the device, motherboard, or adapter. Most cables are keyed so the cable inserts into the connector only one way. However, some cables or connectors are <em>not</em> keyed.</p>
<p class="indent">Removing a cable for the first time requires some muscle. Many cables have a pull tab or plastic piece used to remove the cable from the connector and/or device. Use this if possible and do not yank on the cable. Some cables have connectors with locking tabs. Release the locking tab <em>before</em> disconnecting the cable; otherwise, damage can be done to the cable and/or connector.</p>
<p class="indent">Be careful with hard drive cables. Some of the narrow drive cables, such as the one shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig03">Figure 4.3</a>, are not as sturdy and do not connect as firmly as some of the other computer cables. Also, with this particular cable type, it does not matter which cable end attaches to the device. A 90Â°-angled cable (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig04">Figure 4.4</a>) may attach to devices in a case that has a limited-space design and may have a release latch.</p>

<p class="indent">Each cable has a certain number of pins, and all cables have a <strong><a id="ch04term30" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0719" class="pd_blue">pin 1</a></strong>. Pin 1 on a cable connects to pin 1 on a connector. In the event that the pin 1 is <em>not</em> easily identified, both ends of the cable should be labeled with either a 1 or 2 on one side or a higher number, such as 24, 25, 49, 50, and so on, on the other end. Pins 1 and 2 are always on the same end of a cable. If you find a higher number, pin 1 is on the opposite end. Also, the cable connector usually has an arrow etched into its molding showing the pin 1 connection. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig05">Figure 4.5</a> shows pin 1 on a ribbon cable.</p>

<p class="notepara">Pin 1 on a ribbon cable is easily identified by the colored stripe that runs down the edge of the cable.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_126"></a>Just as every cable has a pin 1, all connectors on devices, adapters, or motherboards have a pin 1. Pin 1 on a cable inserts into pin 1 on a connector. Cables are normally keyed so that they insert only one way. Some manufacturers stencil a 1 or a 2 by the connector on the motherboard or adapter; however, on a black connector, itâs difficult to see the small number. Numbers on adapters are easier to distinguish. When the number 2 is etched beside the adapterâs connector, connect the cableâs pin 1 to this side. Remember that pins 1 and 2 are always on the same side, whether on a connector or on a cable. Some technicians use a permanent marker to label a cableâs function. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig06">Figure 4.6</a> shows an example of a stenciled marking beside an adapterâs connector. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig06">Figure 4.6</a> illustrates the number 2 etched onto the adapter, but other manufacturers stencil a higher number, such as 33, 34, 39, or 40, beside the opposite end of the connector.</p>

<p class="notepara">When connecting cables to a motherboard or internal components, ensure that each cable is connected tightly, evenly, and securely.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Motherboard connectors are usually notched so that the cable inserts only one way; however, not all cables are notched. Some motherboards have pin 1 (or the opposite pin) labeled. Always refer to the motherboard documentation for proper orientation of a cable into a motherboard connector. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig07">Figure 4.7</a> shows the motherboard connectors used for the thin cables shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig03">Figures 4.3</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig04">4.4</a>.

<p class="indent">Some manufacturers do not put any markings on the cable connector; even so, there is a way to determine which way to connect the cable. Remove the adapter, motherboard, or device from the computer. Look where the connector solders or connects to the motherboard or adapter. Turn over the adapter. Notice the silver blobs, known as solder joints, on the back of the motherboard or adapter. Solder joints connect electronic components to the motherboard or adapter. The connectorâs solder joints are normally round, except for the solder joint for pin 1, which is square. Look for the square solder joint on the back of the connector. If the square solder joint is not apparent on the connector, look for other connectors or solder joints that are square. All chips and connectors mount onto a motherboard in the same directionâall pin 1s are normally oriented in the same direction. If one pin 1 is found, the other connectors orient in the same direction. Insert the cable so pin 1 matches the square solder joint of the connector. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig09">Figure 4.9</a> shows a square solder joint for a connector on the back of an adapter.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_128"></a>Specific cables connect a motherboard to lights, ports, or buttons on the front panel. These include the power button, a reset button, USB ports, IEEE 1394 ports, a microphone port, a headphone port, speakers, fans, the hard drive usage light, and the power light, to name a few. Be very careful when removing and reinstalling these cables. Usually, each one of these has a connector that must attach to the appropriate motherboard pins. Be sure to check all ports and buttons once you have reconnected these cables. Refer to the motherboard documentation if your diagramming or notes are inaccurate or if you have no diagrams or notes. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig10">Figure 4.10</a> shows the motherboard pins and the connectors.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec8"><span class="pd_blue">Storage Devices</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hard drives must be handled with care when disassembling a computer. Inside traditional hard drives are hard platters with tiny read/write heads located just millimeters above the platters. If dropped, the read/write heads can touch the platter, causing damage to the platter and/or the read/write heads. The platter is used to store data and applications. Todayâs mechanical hard drives have self-parking heads that pull the heads away to a safe area when the computer is powered off or in a power-saving mode. Always be careful neither to jolt nor to jar the hard drive when removing it from the computer. Even with self-parking heads, improper handling can cause damage to the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indent">A solid-state drive does not contain fragile heads. However, these drives are susceptible to ESD. Use proper antistatic handling procedures when removing/installing them. Store a solid-state drive in an antistatic bag when not in use. Avoid touching the drive with a metal tool.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec9"><a id="page_129"></a><span class="pd_blue">Motherboards</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> covered motherboard replacement extensively, and here we discuss issues related to building a computer from scratch or disassembling a computer: I/O shield, standoffs, and retaining clips. Some cases include a standard I/O panel shield that may need to be removed to install the I/O shield that comes with some motherboards. The <strong><a id="ch04term21" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0465" class="pd_blue">I/O shield</a></strong> is a part what allows for optimum air flow and grounding for the motherboard ports. The I/O shield helps ensure the motherboard is installed correctly and properly aligned with the case. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig11">Figure 4.11</a> shows a motherboard I/O shield.</p>

<p class="indent">Some computer cases have plastic or metal (commonly brass) <strong><a id="ch04term42" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0943" class="pd_blue">standoffs</a></strong> that allow the motherboard to be screwed into the case without the motherboard solder joints touching and grounding to the computer case, causing the motherboard not to work. Some standoffs are plastic, and they slide into slots on the computer case. Do not remove these types of standoffs but just leave them attached and slide the motherboard out of the slots. The most common type of standoff is a metal standoff that screws into the case; this standoff has a threaded side that the motherboard sits on and a screw that attaches the motherboard to the standoff, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig12">Figure 4.12</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_130"></a>Some motherboards not only have screws that attach them to the metal standoffs but one or more retaining clips. A retaining clip might need to be pressed down, lifted up, or bent upward in order to slide the motherboard out of the case. The case might contain one or more notches and require the motherboard to be slid in a particular direction (usually in the direction going away from the back I/O ports) before being lifted from the case.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec10"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Issues</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a> contains information on removing laptop keyboards, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> includes information on removing laptop adapters, motherboards, and CPUs. Other laptop issues relating to disassembling a laptop include memory, plastics, the DC power jack, and the speaker. Whenever taking anything out of a laptop, one of the major issues is tiny screws. Many manufacturers label the type of screen or location for ease of explaining disassembly. Always keep like screws together (in containers or an egg carton) and take notes. All the parts are manufacturer dependent, but the following explanation and graphics/photos should help with these portable devices.</p>
<p class="indent">Laptop memory and expansion cards are commonly located in a bottom compartment accessed by removing a screw. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig13">Figure 4.13</a> shows this on a netbook computer.</p>

<p class="indent">Laptop/netbook speakers commonly mount above or to the side of the keyboard. The keyboard usually has to be removed to reach the speakers. Sometimes, speaker cables run alongside the keyboard and must be pried out of the case. The DC power plug commonly has a similar cable, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig15">Figure 4.15</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec11"><a id="page_132"></a><span class="pd_blue">Reassembly</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Reassembling a computer is easy if the technician is careful and properly diagrams the disassembly. Simple tasks such as inserting the optical drive in the correct drive bay become confusing after many parts have been removed. Writing down reminders takes less time than having to troubleshoot the computer because of poor reassembly. Reinsert all components into their proper place; be careful to replace all screws and parts. Install missing slot covers, if possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Three major reassembly components are motherboards, cables, and connectors. When reinstalling a motherboard, reverse the procedure used during disassembly. Ensure that the motherboard is securely seated into the case and that all retaining clips and/or screws are replaced. This procedure requires practice, but eventually a technician will be able to tell when a motherboard is seated into the case properly. Visual inspection can also help. Ensure that the ports extend fully from the case through the I/O shield. As a final step, ensure that the drives and cover are aligned properly when the case is reinstalled.</p>
<p class="indent">Cables and connectors are the most common source of reassembly problems once the motherboard is installed. Ensure that cables are fully attached to devices and the motherboard. Ensure that power cables are securely attached. Matching pin 1 on the cable to pin 1 on the motherboard connector is critical for older ribbon cables. Attaching the correct device to the correct cable can be difficult if proper notes were not taken.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">Preventive Maintenance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong><a id="ch04term34" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0753" class="pd_blue">Preventive maintenance</a></strong> includes certain procedures performed to prolong the life of a computer. Some computer companies sell maintenance contracts that include preventive maintenance programs. A computer in a normal working environment should be cleaned at least once a year. Typical preventive measures include vacuuming the computer/printer and cleaning the optical drive laser, keyboard keys, printers, and display screen. Be sure to power down the computer and remove the power cord for any computer, remove the battery and AC adapter for a laptop/netbook, and allow a laser printer to cool before accessing internal parts. Preventive exercises for many individual devices are described in their respective chapters. For example, the steps detailing how to clean CDs/DVDs/BDs are included in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>. This section gives an overview of a preventive maintenance program and some general tips about cleaning solvents.</p>
<p class="indent">When performing preventive maintenance, power on the computer to be certain it operates. Perform an audio and visual inspection of the computer as it boots. It is a terrible feeling to perform preventive maintenance on a computer only to power it on and find it does not work. You will wonder if the cleaning you performed caused the problem or if the computer had a problem before the preventive maintenance.</p>
<p class="indent">Repair companies frequently provide a preventive maintenance kit for service calls. The kit normally includes a portable vacuum cleaner, special vacuum cleaner bags for laser printers, a can of compressed air, a floppy head cleaning kit, urethane swabs, monitor wipes, lint-free cloths, general-purpose cloths, general-purpose cleanser, denatured alcohol, a mouse ball cleaning kit, an antistatic brush, gold contact cleaner, and an optical drive cleaning kit.</p>
<p class="indent">The vacuum is used to suck dirt from the inside of the computer. Ensure that you use nonmetallic attachments. Some vacuum cleaners have the ability to blow air. Vacuum first and then set the vacuum cleaner to blow to get dust out of hard-to-reach places. Compressed air can also be used in these situations. The floppy head cleaning kit is used to clean the read/write heads on the floppy drive. Monitor wipes are used on the front of the monitor screen. Monitor wipes with antistatic solution work best.</p>
<p class="indent">Urethane swabs are used to clean between the keys on a keyboard. If a key is sticking, remove the keyboard before spraying or using contact cleaner on it. Touchpads normally require no maintenance except being wiped with a dampened lint-free cloth to remove residual finger oil.</p>
<p class="indent">General-purpose cleanser is used to clean the outside of the case and to clean the desktop areas under and around the computer. Never spray or pour liquid on any computer part. Liquid cleaners are used with soft lint-free cloths or lint-free swabs.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><a id="page_133"></a><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Be careful when cleaning LCD monitors and laptop displays</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Use one of the following to clean LCD monitors and laptop displays: (1) wipes specifically designed for LCDs or (2) a soft lint-free cloth dampened with either water or a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. Never put liquid directly on the display and ensure that the display is dry before closing the laptop.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Denatured alcohol is used on rubber rollers, such as those found inside printers. An antistatic brush can be used to brush dirt away from hard-to-reach places. Gold contact cleaner is used to clean adapter contacts as well as contacts on laptop batteries and the contacts where the battery inserts. A useful CD/DVD/BD cleaning kit can include a lens cleaner that removes dust and debris from an optical lens; a disk cleaner that removes dust, dirt, fingerprints, and oils from the disk; and a scratch repair kit used to resurface, clean, and polish CDs, DVDs, and BDs.</p>
<p class="indent">Many cleaning solution companies provide MSDS (material safety data sheets) that contain information about a product, including its toxicity, storage, disposal, and health/safety concerns. Your state may also have specific disposal procedures for chemical solvents. Check with the companyâs safety coordinator for storage and disposal information.</p>
<p class="indent">To perform the preventive maintenance, power off the computer, remove the power cord, and vacuum the computer with a nonmetallic attachment. Do not start with compressed air or by blowing dust out of the computer because the dirt and dust will simply go into the air and eventually fall back into the computer and surrounding equipment. After vacuuming as much as possible, use compressed air to blow the dust out of hard-to-reach places, such as inside the power supply and under the motherboard. If you are performing maintenance on a notebook computer, remove as many modules as possible, such as the optical drive, battery, and hard drive, before vacuuming or using compressed air. Inform people in the immediate area that they might want to leave the area if they have allergies.</p>

During the maintenance procedure, communicate with the user. Ask if the computer has been giving anyone trouble lately or if it has been performing adequately. Computer users like to know that you care about their computing needs. Also, users frequently ask questions such as whether sunlight or cold weather harms the computer. Always respond with answers the user can understand. Users appreciate it when you explain things in terms they comprehend and that make sense.</p>

<p class="noindent">A technician needs to know a few basic electronic terms and concepts when testing components. The best place to start is with electricity. There are two types of electricity: AC and DC. The electricity provided by a wall outlet is <strong><a id="ch04term01" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0004" class="pd_blue">AC</a></strong> (alternating current), and the type of electricity used by computer components is <strong><a id="ch04term15" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0205" class="pd_blue">DC</a></strong> (direct current). Devices such as radios, TVs, and toasters use AC power. Low-voltage DC power is used for a computerâs internal components and anything powered by batteries. A computerâs power supply converts AC electricity from the wall outlet to DC for the internal components. Electricity involves electrons flowing through a conductor, similar to the way that water runs through a pipe. With AC, the electrons flow alternately in both directions. With DC, the electrons flow in one direction only.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec14"><span class="pd_blue">Electronics Terms</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Voltage, current, power, and resistance are terms commonly used in the computer industry. <strong><a id="ch04term52" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1069" class="pd_blue">Voltage</a></strong>, which is a measure of the pressure pushing electrons through a circuit, is measured in <strong><a id="ch04term51" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1068" class="pd_blue">volts</a></strong>. A power supplyâs output is measured in volts. Power supplies typically put out +3.3 volts, +5 volts, +12 volts, and â12 volts. You will commonly see these voltages shown in power supply documentation as +5V or +12V. Another designation is +5VSB. This is for the computerâs <strong><a id="ch04term41" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0942" class="pd_blue">standby power</a></strong>. This power is always provided, even when the computer is powered off. This supplied voltage is why you have to unplug a computer when working inside it.</p>
<p class="indent">The term <em>volts</em> is also used to describe voltage from a wall outlet. Wall outlet voltage is normally 120VAC (120 volts AC). Exercises at the end of the chapter explain how to take both AC and DC voltage readings. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig16">Figure 4.16</a> shows a photograph of a multimeter being used to take a DC voltage reading on the power connectors coming from a power supply. When the meter leads are inserted correctly, the voltage level shown is of the correct polarity.</p>

<p class="notepara">When a technician measures the voltage coming out of a power supply, the black meter lead (which is negative) connects to the black wire from the power supply (which is ground). The red meter lead connects to either the +5 or +12 volt wires from the power supply.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_135"></a>The reading on the meter could be the opposite of what it should be if the meterâs leads are reversed. Since electrons flow from one area where there are many of them (negative polarity) to an area where there are few electrons (positive polarity), polarity shows which way an electric current will flow. Polarity is the condition of being positive or negative with respect to some reference point. Polarity is not important when measuring AC. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig17">Figure 4.17</a> shows rules to observe when working with meters.</p>

<p class="indent">Monitors and power supplies can have dangerous voltage levels. Monitors can have up to 35,000 volts going to the back of the CRT. Note that flat-panel displays and mobile device displays use low DC voltage and AC voltage, but not at the voltage levels of CRTs. 120 volts AC is present inside the power supply. Power supplies and monitors have capacitors inside them.

In the water pipe analogy, voltage is the amount of pressure applied to force the water through the pipe, and current is the amount of water flowing. Every device needs a certain amount of current to operate. A power supply is rated for the amount of total current (in amps) it can supply at each voltage level. For example, a power supply could be rated at 20 amps for the 5-volt level and 8 amps for the 12-volt level.</p>

A conductor (wire) in a cable or a good fuse will have very low resistance to electricity (close to zero ohms). A broken wire or a bad fuse will have a very high resistance (millions of ohms, sometimes shown as infinite ohms, or OL). For example, a cable is normally made up of several wires that go from one connector to another. If you measure the continuity from <a id="page_136"></a>one end of a wire to the other, it should show no resistance. If the wire has a break in it, the meter shows infinite resistance. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig18">Figure 4.18</a> shows examples of a good wire reading and a broken wire reading.</p>

<p class="notepara">Some connectors have small pin connections. Use a thin meter probe or insert a thin wire, such as a paper clip, into the hole and touch the meter to the wire to take your reading.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Polarity is not important when performing a continuity check. Either meter lead (red or black) can be placed at either end of the wire. However, you do need a pin-out diagram (wiring list) for the cable before you can check continuity because pin 1 at one end could connect to a different pin number at the other end. An exercise at the end of the chapter steps through this process.</p>
<p class="indent">The same concept of continuity applies to fuses. A fuse has a tiny wire inside it that extends from end to end. The fuse is designed so that the wire melts (breaks) if too much current flows through it. The fuse keeps excessive current from damaging electronic circuits or starting a fire. A fuse is rated for a particular amount of current. For example, a 5-amp fuse protects a circuit if the amount of current exceeds 5 amps.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec15"><span class="pd_blue">Power Supply Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A power supply is an essential component within a computer; no internal computer device works without it. The power supply converts AC to DC, distributes lower-voltage DC power to components throughout the computer, and provides cooling through the use of a fan located inside the power supply. The AC voltage a power supply accepts is normally either 100 to 120 volts or 200 to 240 volts. Some dual-voltage power supplies can accept either. This type of power supply can have a selector switch on the back or can automatically detect the input voltage level. The power supply is sometimes a source of unusual problems. The effects of the problems can range from those not noticed by the user to those that shut down the system.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two basic types of power supplies: switching and linear. A computer uses a switching power supply. It provides efficient power to all the computerâs internal components (and possibly to some external ones, such as USB devices). It also generates minimum heat, comes in small sizes, and is cheaper than linear power supplies. A switching power supply requires a load (something attached to it) in order to operate properly. With todayâs power supplies, a motherboard is usually a sufficient load, but a technician should always check the power supply specifications to be sure.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec16"><a id="page_138"></a><span class="pd_blue">Power Supply Form Factors</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just as motherboards come in different shapes and sizes, so do power supplies. Todayâs power supply form factors are ATX, ATX12V v1.x, ATX12V v2.x, and micro-ATX. Other form factors include LFX12V (low profile), SFX12V (small form factor), EPS12V (used with server motherboards and has an extra 8-pin connector), CFX12V (compact form factor), SFX12V (small form factor), TFX12V (thin form factor), WTX12V (workstation form factor for high-end workstations and select servers), and FlexATX (smaller systems that have no more than three expansion slots). Intel, AMD, and video card manufacturers certify specific power supplies that work with their processors and video cards. A computer manufacturer can also have a proprietary power supply form factor that is not compatible with different computer models or other vendorsâ machines. Laptop power supplies are commonly proprietary.</p>

When the computer is turned on, part of POST is to allow the power supply to run a test on each of the voltage levels. The voltage levels must be correct before any other devices are tested and allowed to initialize. If the power is okay, a power good signal is sent to the motherboard. If the power good signal is not sent from the power supply, a timer chip on the motherboard resets the CPU. Once a power good signal is sent, the CPU begins executing software from the BIOS. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig21">Figure 4.21</a> also shows the +5vsb connection to provide standby power for features such as Wake on LAN or Wake on Ring (covered later in this chapter).</p>

<p class="indent">A high-quality power supply delays sending the power good signal until all of the power supplyâs voltages have a chance to stabilize. Some cheap power supplies do not delay the power good signal. Other cheap power supplies do not provide the power good circuitry, but instead, tie 5 volts to the signal (which sends a power good signal even when it is not there).</p>
<p class="indent">The number and quantity of connectors available on a power supply depends on the power supply manufacturer. If a device requires a Berg connector and the only one available is a Molex, a Molex-to-Berg connector converter can be purchased. If a SATA device needs a power connection, a Molex-to-SATA converter is available. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig22">Figure 4.22</a> shows a Molex-to-SATA converter and a Molex-to-Berg converter.</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Provide DC voltage to the motherboard, adapters, and peripheral devices</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Provide cooling and facilitate air flow through the case</p>
<p class="indent">One purpose of a power supply is to convert AC to DC so the computer has proper power to run its components. An ATX power supply does not connect to the front panel switch as the old AT-style power supplies did. With the ATX power supply, a connection from the front panel switch to the motherboard simply provides a 5-volt signal that allows the motherboard to tell the power supply to turn on. This 5-volt signal allows ATX power supplies to support ACPI, which is covered later in the chapter, and also lets the motherboard and operating system control the power supply. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig24">Figures 4.24</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig25">4.25</a> show the front panel connections to the motherboard on two different computers.</p>

<p class="notepara">If an ATX power supply switch is present and in the off position, the motherboard and operating system cannot turn on the power supply. Some ATX power supplies do not have external on/off switches, and the computer can be powered down only via the operating system.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Another purpose of a power supply is to distribute proper DC voltage to each component. Several cables with connectors come out of the power supply. With ATX motherboards, there is only a 20- or 24-pin connector used to connect power to the motherboard. The power connector inserts only one way into the motherboard connector. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig26">Figure 4.26</a> shows an ATX connector being inserted into a motherboard.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 4.26.</span> Installing an ATX power connector on a motherboard</p>
<p class="indent">Another purpose for a power supply is to provide cooling for the computer. The power supplyâs fan circulates air throughout the computer. Most computer cases have air vents on one side, on both sides, or in the rear of the computer. The ATX-style power supply blows air inside the case instead of out the back. This is known as reverse flow cooling. The air blows over the processor and memory to keep them cool. This type of power supply keeps the inside of the computer cleaner than older styles.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Donât block air vents</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Whether a computer is a desktop model, a tower model, or a desktop model mounted in a stand on the floor, ensure that nothing blocks the air vents in the computer case. Do not place a laptop on a blanket or pillow, causing the vents to be blocked.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Electronic components generate a great deal of heat but are designed to withstand fairly high temperatures. Auxiliary fans can be purchased to help cool the internal components of a computer. Some cases have an extra mount and cutout for an auxiliary fan. Some auxiliary fans mount in adapter slots or drive bays.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Be careful when installing an auxiliary fan</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Place the fan so the outflow of air moves in the same direction as the flow of air generated by the power supply. If an auxiliary fan is installed inside a case in the wrong location, the auxiliary air flow could work against the power supply air flow, reducing the cooling effect. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig19">Figure 2.19</a> in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> details how air flow can be aided with an auxiliary fan.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec18"><span class="pd_blue">Power Supply Voltages</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig21">Figure 4.21</a> and notice how +3.3, +5, â5, +12, and â12 volts are supplied to the motherboard. The motherboard and adapters use +3.3 and +5 volts. The â5 volts is seldom used. If the motherboard has integrated serial ports, they sometimes use +12V and â12V power. Hard drives and optical drives commonly use +5 and +12 volts. The +12 voltage is used to operate <a id="page_144"></a>the device motors found in drives, the CPU, internal cooling fans, and the graphics card. Drives are now being made that use +5V motors. Chips use +5 volts and +3.3 volts. The +3.3 volts are also used for memory, AGP/PCI/PCIe adapters, and some laptop fans. The negative voltages are seldom used.</p>
<p class="indent">A technician must occasionally check voltages in a system. There are four basic checks for power supply situations: (1) wall outlet AC voltage, (2) DC voltages going to the motherboard, (3) DC voltages going to a device, and (4) ground or lack of voltage with an outlet tester. A <strong><a id="ch04term33" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0747" class="pd_blue">power supply tester</a></strong> can be used to check DC power levels on the different power supply connectors.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec19"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Travel and Storage</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When traveling with a laptop, remove all cards that insert into slots and store them in containers so that their contacts do not become dirty and cause intermittent problems. Remove all media discs such as CDs, DVDs, or BDs. Check that drive doors and devices are securely latched. Ensure that the mobile device is powered off or in hibernate mode (not in sleep/suspend or standby power mode, which is covered later in this chapter).</p>
<p class="indent">Carry the device in a padded case. If you have to place the device on an airport security conveyor belt, ensure that the device is not placed upside down, which could cause damage to the display. Never place objects on top of a mobile device or pick up a laptop by the edges of the display when the laptop is opened. When shipping a mobile device, place it in a properly padded box. The original shipping box is a safe container.</p>
<p class="indent">The United States has regulations about lithium batteries on airplanes. If battery contacts come in contact with metal or other batteries, the battery could short-circuit and cause a fire. For this reason, any lithium batteries are to be kept in original packaging. If original packaging is not available, place electrical tape over the battery terminals or place each battery in an individual bag. Spare lithium batteries are not allowed in checked baggage but can be taken in carry-on bags.</p>
<p class="indent">Like other electronic devices, laptops have heating issues. The following can help with laptop overheating:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Locate air vents and keep them unblocked and clean. Do not place a laptop on your lap to work.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ In the BIOS settings, check the temperature settings for when fans turn on.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the laptop manufacturer website or documentation for any fan/temperature monitoring gauges.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Place a laptop on something that elevates it from the desk, such as drink coasters. In addition, pads, trays, and mats can be purchased with fans that are AC powered or USB powered.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec20"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Power</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A portable computer (laptop/netbook/ultrabook/tablet) uses either an AC connection or a battery as its power source. On most models, when the mobile device connects to AC power, the battery normally recharges. Laptop batteries are usually modules with one or two release latches that are used to remove the module. Smartphone batteries either have a release latch or you slide part of the phone away and reveal the battery. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig27">Figure 4.27</a> shows a netbook computer with its battery module removed. Battery technologies have improved in the past few years, probably due to the development of more devices that need battery power, such as tablets, digital cameras, and portable CD, DVD, and BD players.</p>

<p class="notepara">Some power supplies and laptops have input voltage selectors; others have the ability to accept input from 100 to 240 volts for use in various countries (dual voltage). Ensure that the power supply accepts or is set to the proper input voltage.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_145"></a>NiCad (nickel cadmium) batteries originally used in laptops were replaced with lighter and more powerful NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) batteries. These batteries were replaced with <strong><a id="ch04term22" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0537" class="pd_blue">Li-ion</a></strong> (lithium-ion) <span class="pd_blue"><strong>batteries</strong></span>, which are very light and can hold a charge longer than any other type. They are also more expensive. Mobile phones, tablets, portable media players, and digital cameras also use Li-ion batteries. These batteries lose their charge over time even if they are not being used. Use your laptop with battery-provided power. Ensure that a laptop that has an Li-ion battery is not plugged into an AC outlet all the time. Calibrate a laptop battery according to manufacturer instructions so the battery meter displays correctly.</p>

<p class="notepara">Computers are designed to work within a range of temperatures, but sudden change is not good for them. If a mobile device is in a car all night and the temperature drops, allow the device to return to room temperature before powering on. Avoid direct sunlight. Inside the computer case, it is usually 40Â°F hotter than outside.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Li-ion polymer batteries are similar to Li-ion batteries except that they are packed in pouched cells. This design allows for smaller batteries and a more efficient use of space, which is important in the portable computer and mobile devices industries. For environmentalists, the zinc-air battery is the one to watch. AER Energy Resources, Inc., has several patents on a battery that uses oxygen to generate electricity. Air is allowed to flow during battery discharge and is blocked when the battery is not in use. This battery holds a charge for extended periods of time. Another upcoming technology is fuel cells. Fuel cells used for a laptop can provide power for 5 to 10 hours.</p>

<p class="notepara">Li-ion batteries do not suffer from the memory effect, as do some nickel-based batteries. Fully discharging a lithium battery, such as an Li-ion battery, is actually bad for it. However, most lithium batteries have a circuit to prevent the battery from being totally discharged.</p>
<hr></div>
<div class="note"><hr>

<p class="notepara">Li-ion batteries last longer if they are kept cool (not frozen). When you store an Li-ion battery, the battery should be only 40 percent charged and placed in a refrigerator to prolong its life.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Mobile devices rely on their batteries to provide the mobility. The following tips can help you get more time out of your batteries:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Most people do not need a spare Li-ion battery. If you are not using an Li-ion battery constantly, it is best not to buy a spare. The longer the spare sits unused, the shorter the lifespan it will have.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Buy the battery recommended by the laptop manufacturer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For a mobile device or smartphone, use an AC outlet rather than a USB port for faster charging.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If using a USB port for charging a mobile device or smartphone, unplug all unused USB devices. Note that not all USB ports can provide a charge if the host device is in sleep mode.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not use the optical player when running on battery power.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Turn off the wireless adapter if a wireless network is not being used. For Windows-based devices, use the <em>Network and Internet</em> Control Panel. For smaller mobile devices, use flight mode to turn off both the wireless and the cellular (3G/4G) networks. Apple iOS devices can use <em>Settings</em> to access <em>Airplane Mode</em>. Android devices can use the <em>Settings</em> option to access <em>Flight mode</em> through the <em>Wireless and network</em> option.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ In the power options, configure the mobile device for hibernate rather than standby (covered later in the chapter).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Save work only when necessary and turn off the autosave feature.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Reduce the screen brightness. In Windows, use the <em>Display</em> Control Panel link found within the <em>Hardware and Sound</em> Control Panel. In Apple iOS, us the <em>Brightness &amp; Wallpaper</em> setting; on an Android device, use the <em>Sound and display</em> option from the <em>Settings</em> application.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Keep the hard drive defragmented especially before running on battery power.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid using external USB devices such as flash drives or external hard drives.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Add more RAM to reduce swapping of information from the hard drive to RAM to CPU or to just be more efficient.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Keep battery contacts clean with a dab of rubbing alcohol on a lint-free swab once a month.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use your mobile device until the battery is drained when possible and then recharge it. Constantly recharging the battery reduces the battery life. Most lithium batteries have a circuit that keeps the battery from being discharged completely.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid running multiple programs. To close an application on an iOS-based device, hold down on the icon from the home menu. On an Android-based device, use the <em>Applications</em> &gt; <em>Manage Applications</em> option from the <em>Settings</em> application.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disable automatic updates. In Windows, use the <em>Windows Update</em> link from the <em>System and Security</em> Control Panel. On iOS or Android systems, disable push reports and application notifications that make sounds or vibrations from within the <em>Settings</em> option. Have the OS check less often for mail; use the <em>Mail, Contacts, Calendars</em> option to change the settings.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid temperature extremes.</p>

<p class="notepara">A technician needs to replace a power supply with one that provides an equal or greater amount of power. Search the Internet for power supply reviews. A general rule of thumb is that if two power supplies are equal in wattage, the heavier one is better because it uses a bigger transformer, bigger heat sinks, and more quality components.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec21"><span class="pd_blue">ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Todayâs computer user needs to leave a computer on for extended periods of time in order to receive faxes, run computer maintenance tasks, automatically answer phone calls, and download software upgrades and patches. Network managers want control of computers so they can push out software upgrades, perform backups, download software upgrades and patches, and perform tests. Laptop users have always been plagued by power management problems, such as short battery life, inconsistent handling of screen blanking, and screen blanking in the middle of presentations. Such problems occurred because originally the BIOS controlled power. Power management has changed.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch04term03" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0010" class="pd_blue">ACPI</a></strong> (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) gives the BIOS and operating system control over various devicesâ power and modes of operation, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig28">Figure 4.28</a>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 4.28.</span> ACPI actions</p>
<p class="indent">With ACPI, the user can control how the power switch operates and when power to specific devices, such as the hard drive and monitor, is lowered. For example, the <em>Instant On/Off</em> BIOS setting can control how long the power switch is held in before the power supply turns on or off. Case temperatures, CPU temperatures, and CPU fans can be monitored. The power supply can be adjusted for power requirements. The CPU clock can be throttled or slowed down to keep the temperature lower and prolong the life of the CPU and reduce power requirements especially in portable devices when activity is low or nonexistent. ACPI has various operating states, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04tab03">Table 4.3</a>.</p>

Software applications can also use the Wake on LAN feature to perform updates, upgrades, and maintenance tasks. The feature can also be used to bring up computers immediately before the business day starts. Wake on LAN can be used with Web or network cameras to start recording when motion is detected or to bring up a network printer so that it can be used when needed. <strong><a id="ch04term54" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1074" class="pd_blue">Wake on Ring</a></strong> allows a computer to come out of sleep mode when the telephone line has an incoming call.

<p class="noindent">Power supplies are rated in watts. Todayâs typical computers have power supplies with ratings ranging from 250 to 500 watts, although powerful computers, such as network servers or higher-end gaming systems, can have power supplies rated 600 watts or higher. Each device inside a computer uses a certain amount of power, and the power supply must provide enough to run all the devices. The power each device or adapter requires is usually defined in the documentation for the device or adapter or on the manufacturerâs website. The computer uses the wattage needed, not the total capacity of a power supply. The efficiency (more AC is converted to DC) is what changes the electricity bill.</p>

<p class="indent">Some power supplies are listed as being dual or triple (or tri) rail. A <strong><a id="ch04term16" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0286" class="pd_blue">dual-rail power supply</a></strong> has two +12V output lines. A triple-rail power supply simply has three +12V output lines for devices. Keep in mind that most manufacturers do not have two or more independent 12V sources; they all derive from the same 12V source but have independent output lines. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig30">Figure 4.30</a> shows how the +12V rails might be used.</p>

<p class="indent">Power supplies can be auto-switching or have a fixed input. An <strong><a id="ch04term06" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0062" class="pd_blue">auto-switching</a></strong> power supply monitors the incoming voltage from the wall outlet and automatically switches itself accordingly. Auto-switching power supplies accept voltages from 100 to 240VAC at 50 to 60Hz. These power supplies are popular in mobile devices and are great for international travel. A power supply might also allow adjusting the input value by manually selecting the value through a voltage selector switch on the power supply. A fixed-input power supply is rated for a specific voltage and frequency for a country, such as 120VAC 60Hz for the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people are interested in exactly how much power their system is consuming. Every device in a computer consumes power, and each device could use one or more different voltage levels (+5V, â5V, +12V, â12V, +3.3V). A power supply has a maximum amperage for each voltage level (for example, 30 amps at +5 volts and 41 amps at +12V). To determine the maximum power being used, in watts, multiply the amps and volts. If you add all the maximum power levels, the amount will be greater than the power supplyâs rating. This means that you cannot use the maximum power at every single voltage level (but since the â5V and â12V are not used very often, normally this is not a problem).</p>
<p class="indent">In order to determine the power being consumed, you must research every device to determine how much current it uses at a specific voltage level. Internet power calculators are available to help with this task. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04tab06">Table 4.6</a> lists sample computer componentsâ power requirements.</p>

<p class="indent">Different physical sizes of power supplies are available. When replacing a power supply, purchasing a power supply for a new computer, or upgrading a power supply, verify that the power supply will fit in the computer case. Also, verify that the power supply produces enough power for the installed devices and for future upgrades. Do not forget to check that the on/off switch on the new power supply is in a location that fits in the computer case.</p>
<p class="indent">When purchasing a new power brick for a laptop or battery for a mobile device, ensure that it has the same specifications as the one from the manufacturer. Less expensive models might not provide the same quality as approved models. Ensure that the replacement has a power jack that does not wiggle when it is inserted into the device. Ensure that a laptop power brick has the appropriate DC voltage required by the laptop. Current (amperage) should be equal to or more than the original power brick.</p>
<p class="indent">Power management on both laptops and desktops is important. Most computer components are available as energy-efficient items. ENERGY STAR is a joint effort by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and Department of Energy to provide device standards and ratings that easily identify products (including computer components) that are energy efficient. Many computers today are on more than they are off, and settings such as power options, CPU throttling, and some advanced BIOS settings affect power settings. A technician must be aware of all these options and be willing to offer advice such as turn the computer off when finished working on it; set the power management option to allow work to be performed at an affordable cost; disable options not being used, such as wireless capabilities when wired networking is functioning; be aware of monitor costs (CRT-type monitors take the most energy, followed by plasma displays and then LCD or flat-panel technology); and purchase energy-efficient parts and computers.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec23"><span class="pd_blue">Symptoms of Power Supply Problems</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The following is a list of symptoms of a power supply problem:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The power light is off and/or the device wonât turn on.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The power supply fan does not turn when the computer is powered on.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_153"></a>â¢ The computer sounds a continuous beep. (This could also be a bad motherboard or a stuck key on the keyboard.)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When the computer powers on, it does not beep at all. (This could also be a bad motherboard.)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When the computer powers on, it sounds repeating short beeps. (This could also be a bad motherboard.)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ During POST, a 02<em>X</em> or parity POST error code appears (where <em>X</em> is any number); one of the POST checks is a power good signal from the power supply; a 021, 022, . . . error message indicates that the power supply did not pass the POST test.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The computer reboots or powers down without warning.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The power supply fan is noisy.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The power supply is too hot to touch.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The computer emits a burning smell.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The power supply fan spins, but there is no power to other devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The monitor has power light, but nothing appears on the monitor, and no PC power light illuminates.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec24"><span class="pd_blue">Solving Power Supply Problems</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you suspect that the power supply is causing a problem, swap the power supply, make the customer happy, and be on your way! Power problems are not usually difficult to detect or troubleshoot.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not overlook the most obvious power supply symptom. Start by checking the computer power light. If it is off, check the power supplyâs fan by placing your palm at the back of the computer. If the fan is turning, it means the wall outlet is providing power to the computer and you can assume that the wall outlet is functioning. Check the motherboard for LEDs and refer to the manual for their meaning. Test the power outlet with another device. Ensure that the power cord is inserted fully into the wall outlet and the computer. If you suspect that the wall outlet is faulty, use an <strong><a id="ch04term02" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0005" class="pd_blue">AC circuit tester</a></strong> to verify that the wall outlet is wired properly.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Do not disassemble a power supply</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Power supplies are not normally disassembled. Manufacturers often rivet them shut. Even when a power supply can be disassembled, you should not take it apart unless you have a background in electronics.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">On a mobile device that is running on battery power, check the battery charge icon through the operating system. Try using the device on AC power. If it works on AC power, try recharging the battery. If the battery does not recharge, replace it. Wiggle the AC power to see if the connection is loose. Remove the battery for a moment and then re-insert it (and attach AC power if battery power does not work). On a laptop, see if the power brick has a power light on it and whether it is lit. Try a different AC adapter from the same manufacturer because AC adapters are proprietary between laptop vendors.</p>
<p class="indent">If a mobile device or smartphone wonât power on after recharging the battery, remove the battery for about a minute. Reinstall the battery and try powering on again. If the system will still not power on, try powering on with the power cable attached. If the system works with the power cable attached, the battery probably needs to be replaced.</p>
<p class="indent">The following troubleshooting questions can help you determine the location of a power problem:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Did the power supply work before? If not, check the input voltage selector switch on the power supply and verify that it is on the proper setting.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the power supplyâs fan turning? If yes, check voltages going to the motherboard. If they are good, maybe just the power supply fan is bad. If the power supplyâs fan is not turning, check the wall outlet for proper AC voltages.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_154"></a>â¢ Is a surge strip used? If so, check to see if the surge strip is powered on, then try a different outlet in the surge strip, or replace the surge strip.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the computerâs power cord okay? Verify that the power cord plugs snugly into the outlet and into the back of the computer. Swap the power cord to verify that it is functioning.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the front panel power button stuck?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Are the voltages going to the motherboard at the proper levels? If they are low, something may be overloading the power supply. Disconnect the power cable to one device and recheck the voltages. Replace the power cable to the device. Remove the power cable from another device and recheck the motherboard voltages. Continue doing this until the power cord for each device has been disconnected and the motherboard voltages have been checked. A single device can short out the power supply and cause the system to malfunction. Replace any device that draws down the power supplyâs output voltage and draws too much current. If none of the devices is the cause of the problem, replace the power supply. If replacing the power supply does not solve the problem, replace the motherboard.</p>
<p class="indent">If a computer does not boot properly, but it does boot when you press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/ctrl.jpg" alt="Image" width="34" height="21"></span>+ <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4.

Disassembly and Power_files/del.jpg" alt="Image" width="35" height="20"></span>, the power good signal is likely the problem. Some motherboards are more sensitive to the power good signal than others. For example, say that a motherboard has been replaced and the system does not boot. At first glance, this may appear to be a bad replacement board, but the problem could be caused by a power supply failing to output a consistent power good signal.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Check the power good (sometimes called power OK) signal</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Check the power supply documentation to see if the power supply outputs a power good signal (rather than the normal +5 volts). Turn on the computer. Check the power good signal going into the motherboard power connector. Do this before replacing the motherboard. A power supply with a power good signal below +3V needs to be replaced.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, none of these troubleshooting actions work. A grounding problem might be the issue. Build the computer outside the computer case, on an antistatic mat, if possible. Start with only the power supply, motherboard, and speaker connected. Even though it will normally produce a POST audio error, verify that the power supply fan will turn. Most power supplies issue a click before the audio POST beeps. Next, verify the voltages from the power supply. If the fan turns and the voltages are correct, power down the machine and add a video adapter and monitor to the system. If the machine does not work, put the video adapter in a different expansion slot and try again. If placing the video adapter in a different expansion slot does not work, swap out the video adapter.</p>
<p class="indent">If the video adapter works, continue adding devices one by one and checking the voltages. Just as any one device can cause the system not to operate properly, so can any one adapter. If one particular adapter causes the system to malfunction, try a different expansion slot before trying a different adapter.</p>
<p class="indent">If the expansion slot proves to be a problem, check the slot for foreign objects. If none are found but the problem still occurs, place a note on the expansion slot so that no one will use it.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec25"><span class="pd_blue">Adverse Power Conditions</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are two adverse AC power conditions that can damage or adversely affect a computer: overvoltage and undervoltage. <strong><a id="ch04term28" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0677" class="pd_blue">Overvoltage</a></strong> occurs when the output voltage from the wall outlet (the AC voltage) is over the rated amount. Normally, the output of a wall outlet is 110 to 130 volts AC. When the voltage rises above 130 volts, an overvoltage condition exists. The power supply takes the AC voltage and converts it to DC. An overvoltage condition is harmful to the components because too much DC voltage destroys electronic circuits. An overvoltage condition can be a surge or a spike.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_155"></a>When the voltage falls below 110 volts AC, an <strong><a id="ch04term49" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1033" class="pd_blue">undervoltage</a></strong> condition exists. If the voltage is too low, a computer power supply cannot provide enough power to all the components. Under these conditions, the power supply draws too much current, causing it to overheat, weakening or damaging the components. An undervoltage condition is known as a brownout or sag. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04tab07">Table 4.7</a> explains these power terms.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/04tab07.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="483"></div>
<p class="indent">Electric companies offer surge protection for homes. Frequently, there are two choices. A basic package protects large appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners, washers, and dryers. It allows no more than 800 volts to enter the electrical system. A premium package protects more sensitive devices (TVs, stereos, and computers) and reduces the amount of voltage allowed to 323 volts or less. Some suppressors handle surges up to 20,000 volts. The exterior surge arrestor does not protect against voltage increases that originate inside the building, such as those caused by faulty wiring.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec26"><span class="pd_blue">Adverse Power Protection</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Power supplies have built-in protection against adverse power conditions. However, the best protection for a computer is to unplug it during a power outage or thunderstorm. Surge protectors and UPSs (uninterruptible power supplies) are commonly used to protect against adverse power conditions. A line conditioner can also be used. Each device has a specific purpose and guards against certain conditions. A technician must be familiar with each device in order to make recommendations for customers.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec27"><span class="pd_blue">Surge Protectors</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A <strong><a id="ch04term44" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0956" class="pd_blue">surge protector</a></strong>, also known as a surge strip or surge suppressor, is commonly a multi-outlet strip that offers built-in protection against overvoltage. Surge protectors do not protect against undervoltage; they protect against voltage increases. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig31">Figure 4.31</a> shows a picture of a surge protector.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 4.31.</span> Surge protector</p>
<p class="indent">Most surge protectors have an electronic component called an <strong><a id="ch04term26" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0605" class="pd_blue">MOV</a></strong> (metal oxide varistor), which protects the computer or device that plugs into one of the outlets on the surge strip. An MOV is positioned between the AC coming in and the outlet into which devices are plugged. When a surge occurs, the MOV prevents the extra voltage from passing to the outlets. An MOV, however, has some drawbacks. If a large surge occurs, the MOV will take the hit and be destroyed, which is better than damaging the computer. However, with small overvoltages, each small surge weakens the MOV. A weakened MOV might not give the proper protection to the computer in the event of a bigger surge. Also, there is no simple check for an MOVâs condition. Some MOVs have indicator lamps attached, but they indicate only when the MOV has been destroyed, not when it is weakened. Still, having an indicator lamp is better than nothing at all. Some surge protectors also have replaceable fuses and/or indicator lamps for the fuse. A fuse works only once and then is destroyed during a surge in order to protect devices plugged into surge protector outlets.</p>

<p class="notepara">When purchasing or recommending a surge protector, be sure it conforms to the UL 1449 standard and has an MOV status lamp. Also, check to see if the vendor offers to repair or replace the surge-protected equipment in the event that they are damaged during a surge.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Surge protectors are not the best protection for a computer system because most provide very little protection against other adverse power conditions. Even the good ones protect only against overvoltage conditions. Those with the UL 1449 rating and an MOV status lamp are usually more expensive. Unfortunately, people tend to put their money into their computer parts, but not into the protection of those parts.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec28"><span class="pd_blue">Line Conditioners</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An alternative for computer protection is a line conditioner. <strong><a id="ch04term23" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0538" class="pd_blue">Line conditioners</a></strong>, sometimes known as power conditioners, are more expensive than surge protectors, but they protect a computer from overvoltages, undervoltages, and adverse noise conditions over electrical lines. A line conditioner monitors AC electricity. If the voltage is too low, the line conditioner boosts voltage to the proper range. If the voltage level is too high, the line conditioner clamps down the voltage and sends the proper amount to the computer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig32">Figure 4.32</a> shows a line conditioner.</p>

<p class="notepara">A line conditioner is rated for a certain amount of current. Some devices, such as laser printers, can draw a great deal of current (up to 15 amps). Some line conditioners are not rated to handle these devices. Because laser printers draw so much current, if a computer and a laser printer are on the same electrical circuit, that circuit should be wired to a 20-amp circuit breaker. Most outlets in todayâs buildings are on 20-amp breakers.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_158"></a><span class="pd_blue">Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A <strong><a id="ch04term50" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1036" class="pd_blue">UPS</a></strong> (uninterruptible power supply), sometimes called an online (or true) UPS or a line interactive UPS, provides power to a computer or other device for a limited amount of time when there is a power outage. A UPS provides enough time to save work and safely shut down the computer. Some operating systems do not operate properly if power abruptly cuts off and the computer is not brought to a logical stopping place. A network server, the main computer for a network, is a great candidate for a UPS. Network operating systems are particularly susceptible to problems during a power outage. Some UPSs have a connection for a cable and special software that automatically maintains voltages to the computer, quits all applications, and powers off the computer. Some UPS units have USB and/or network connections as well.</p>
<p class="indent">A UPS also provides power conditioning for the devices attached to it. The AC power is used to charge a battery inside the UPS. The battery inside the UPS supplies power to an inverter. The inverter makes AC for the computer. When AC power from the outlet fails, the battery inside the UPS continues to supply power to the computer. The battery inside the UPS outputs DC power, and the computer accepts (and expects) AC power. Therefore, the DC power from the battery must be converted to AC voltage. AC voltage looks like a sine wave when it is in its correct form, but cheaper UPSs produce a square wave (especially when power comes from the battery) that is not as effective. Some computer systems and peripherals do not work well on a 120VAC square wave, modified sine wave, or quasi-sine wave. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig33">Figure 4.33</a> illustrates a sine wave and a square wave.</p>

<p class="indent">A UPS can be the best protection against adverse power conditions because it protects against overvoltage and undervoltage conditions, and it provides power so a system can be shut down properly. When purchasing a UPS, be sure that (1) the amount of battery time is sufficient to protect all devices; (2) the amount of current the UPS produces is sufficient to protect all devices; and (3) the output waveform is a sine wave.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_159"></a>To install a UPS, perform the following steps:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Connect the UPS to a wall outlet and power it on. When a UPS is first plugged in, the battery is not charged. See the UPS manufacturerâs installation manual for the specific time it will take to charge.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Power off the UPS.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Attach device power cords, such as the PC, to the UPS. Ensure that the UPS is rated to supply power to the number and type of connected devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Power on the UPS.</p>
<p class="indent">A UPS has a battery inside that is similar to a car battery (except that the UPS battery is sealed). Because this battery contains acid, you should never drop a UPS or throw it in the trash. Research your stateâs requirements for recycling batteries. All batteries fail after some time, and most UPSs have replaceable batteries.</p>
<p class="indent">UPS troubleshooting is not difficult. In addition to following the manufacturerâs recommendations for troubleshooting, try the following guidelines:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a UPS will not power on, check the on/off switch. Verify that the UPS is attached to an electrical outlet. Ensure that the outlet has power and that the circuit breaker for the outlet has not been tripped. Ensure that the battery is installed properly.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check whether the UPS unit has a self-test procedure and include a self-test button.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ With some UPS units, a beep indicates that a power interruption has occurred. This is a normal function.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Some UPS units beep at a different rate when the battery is low. Others have a light indicator to indicate that itâs time to recharge or replace the battery.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a UPS is overloadedâthat is, has too many devices attachedâthe UPS may shut off, trip a circuit breaker, beep, or turn on a light indication for this problem.</p>

<p class="noindent">A device similar to a UPS is an <strong><a id="ch04term40" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0934" class="pd_blue">SPS</a></strong> (standby power supply). An SPS contains a battery like the UPS, but the battery provides power to the computer only when it loses AC power. It does not provide constant power, like the UPS. An SPS is not as effective as a UPS because the SPS must detect a power-out condition first and then switch over to the battery to supply power to the computer. As a result, SPS switching time is important. Any time under 5 milliseconds is fine for most systems. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig35">Figures 4.35</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig36">4.36</a> show the differences between how SPSs and UPSs work.</p>

<h3 id="ch04lev1sec31"><a id="page_161"></a><span class="pd_blue">Phone Line Isolator</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just like AC power outlets, phone outlets can experience power fluctuations. A power surge can enter a computer through a modem, a device used to connect a computer to a phone line. Not only can a modem be damaged by a power surge on the phone line, but other electronics inside the computer, such as the motherboard, can be damaged. A <strong><a id="ch04term29" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0712" class="pd_blue">phone line isolator</a></strong>, sometimes called a <strong><a id="ch04term24" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0597" class="pd_blue">modem isolator</a></strong>, can be purchased at an electronics store. It provides protection against phone line surges. No computer connected to a phone line through a modem should be without one. Many surge protectors now come with a modem isolator built into the strip. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig31">Figure 4.31</a> shows an example of a surge strip that has modem protection integrated into the unit.</p>
<p class="indent">Power supplies and associated protection equipment are not exciting topics, but they are very important to a technician. Power problems can catch you unaware. Always keep power in your mind as a potential suspect when troubleshooting a computer.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec32"><span class="pd_blue">Electrical Fires</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">No discussion of power is complete without a brief warning about fire. Electrical fires are uncommon in computers, but if one occurs, a technician must know what to do. If a fire occurs inside a computer or peripheral, unplug the equipment if possible, but do not put yourself in harmâs way attempting to do this. Use a <strong><a id="ch04term47" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1021" class="pd_blue">Type C</a></strong> or a <strong><a id="ch04term46" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1020" class="pd_blue">Type A-B-C fire extinguisher</a></strong> to put out the fire. Type C fire extinguishers are made specifically for electrical (Type C) fires. Type A-B-C fire extinguishers can be used for Class A, Class B, and Class C fires. Class A fires involve paper, wood, cloth, or other normal combustibles. Class B fires involve flammable liquids and gases. It is also a good idea to have a dry chemical 20lb ABC fire extinguisher in homes for the electronics (including computers) located there. Home computer equipment should be listed on the home insurance policy. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04fig37">Figure 4.37</a> shows a Type A-B-C fire extinguisher.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch04fig37"></a><img src="./Chapter 4. Disassembly and Power_files/04fig37.jpg" alt="Image" width="800" height="600"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 4.37.</span> Type A-B-C fire extinguisher</p>
<p class="indent">When a fire occurs, pull out the fire extinguisher pin. Aim the fire extinguisher nozzle at the base (bottom) of the fire. Squeeze the fire extinguisherâs handle and move the nozzle back and forth in a slow sweeping motion. With electrical fires, the smoke is a breathing hazard. Burning plastics produce lethal toxic fumes. Always evacuate the people in the building and call the fire department.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec33"><a id="page_162"></a><span class="pd_blue">Computer Disposal/Recycling</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Computers and other electronic devices can contain materials such as beryllium, chromium, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc. The levels of these materials are increasing dramatically every year in landfills and can pose a threat to our environment. Plastics that are part of computers are hard to isolate and recycle. CRTs (cathode ray tubes) are found in older monitors and TVs and usually contain enough lead and mercury to be considered hazardous waste. However, the EPA has been successful in obtaining exclusions from the federal hazardous waste standards for unbroken CRTs, so they can be recycled more effectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Batteries contain acids that can burn or hurt body parts. Batteries can introduce lead and acid into the environment. Heavy metals can leach into the ground and water sources.</p>
<p class="indent">Every state and many cities have specific guidelines about how to dispose of electronics. These rules must be followed by technicians who replace broken computer equipment. For example, in Florida and New York, steps have been taken to increase CRT recycling; however, other states regulate all CRTs as hazardous waste and ban them from being sent to landfills. If you are unsure about how to get rid of any piece of broken electronic equipment, contact your direct supervisor for instructions.</p>
<p class="indent">The following list provides alternatives and suggestions for being environmentally conscious about discarding electronics:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Donate equipment that is operational to schools and charities so that those who do not have access to technology can get some exposure. If the operating system is not transferred to another system, leave the operating system on it and provide proof of purchase along with documentation. Also, do not forget to erase all data stored on the computer before donating it.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Recycle very outdated electronics. If the devices are so outdated that a school or charity does not want them, consider recycling them. Many companies accept old electronics and have determined ways to reuse some of their parts.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove parts that do work and donate or recycle them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Buy electronics that are designed with saving resources in mind and are easy to upgrade, which extends their usefulness period; are energy efficient; contain fewer toxins; use recycled materials; and offer leasing or recycling programs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check with the computer or component manufacturer to see if it has a recycling program. Most of them do.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec34"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâWritten Communications Skills</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When technicians are in school, they seldom think that the skills they should be learning involve writing. However, in the workplace, technicians use written communication skills when they document problems and use email. Advisory committees across the country say that in addition to having technical knowledge, it is important that technicians be able to communicate effectively both written and orally, be comfortable working in a team environment, and possess critical thinking skills (that is, solve problems even though they have not been taught the specific problem).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_163"></a>Regardless of the size of a company, documentation is normally required. The documentation may only be the number of hours spent on a job and a basic description of what was done, but most companies require a bit more. Documentation should be written so others can read and understand it. Keep in mind that if another technician must handle another problem from the same customer, it saves time and money to have good documentation. The following list includes complaints from managers who hire technicians. You can use this list to improve and avoid making the same mistakes:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoids doing documentation in a timely manner</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Does not provide adequate or accurate information on what was performed or tried</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Has poor spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation skills</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Writes in short, choppy sentences, using technical jargon</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Does not provide updates on the status of a problem</p>
<p class="indent">Email is a common means of communication for technicians. However, most technicians do not take the time to communicate effectively using email. The following is a list of guidelines for effective email communication:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not use email when a meeting or a phone call is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Include a short description of the email topic in the subject line.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not write or respond to an email when you are angry.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Send email only to the appropriate people.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Stick to the point; do not digress.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use a spelling and grammar checker; if one is not included in the email client, write the email in a word processing application, check it, and then paste the document into the email.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization; do not write in all uppercase or all lowercase letters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not copy others unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Write each email as if you were putting the message on a billboard; you never know how the content might be used or who might see it.</p>
<p class="indent">The number-one complaint about technical support staff is not their lack of technical skills but their lack of communication skills. Spend as much of your education practicing your communication skills as you do your technical skills.</p>
<h3 id="ch04lev1sec35"><a id="page_164"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Wearing a wrist strap or staying in contact with unpainted metal keeps you and the computing device at the same electrical potential so you wonât induce current into any part and weaken/damage it.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ EMI and RFI cause issues. Move the computer or the offending device and replace all slot covers/openings.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When removing parts, have the right tools, lighting, antistatic items, and ample work space. Take notes. Donât use magnetized tools. Avoid jarring hard drives.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Be careful installing an I/O shield and be aware of standoffs when dealing with the motherboard.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Laptops and mobile devices frequently have compartments for memory and expansion card. These devices frequently have plastic parts that must be removed. A scribe helps with prying plastics and covers off. Laptop speakers and DC power plug frequently have cables that run along the back or sides of the device. Keep screws separated and take notes for any parts removal.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ribbon cables have a colored stripe indicating pin 1. Pin 1 of a cable must attach to pin 1 of a connector.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Preventive maintenance procedures prolong the life of the computer. Vacuum before spraying compressed air.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ An MSDS describes disposal and storage procedures and contains information about toxicity and health concerns. Cities/states have specific disposal rules for chemicals, batteries, CRTs, electronics, and so on. Always know the disposal rules in the area where you work.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ AC power goes into the power supply or mobile device power brick. DC power is provided to all internal parts of the computing device. AC and DC voltage checks can be done and only with DC power does polarity matter. Use the highest meter setting possible with unknown voltage levels. Power is measured in watts.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Continuity checks are done on cabling and a good wire shows close to 0 ohms.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A power supply converts AC to DC, distributes DC throughout a unit, and provides cooling. The power supply must be the correct form factor and able to supply the current amount of wattage for a particular voltage level such as +5V or +12V. Multiple ârailsâ are commonly available for +12V since the CPU commonly needs its own connection. The number and type of connectors vary, but converters can be purchased.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Li-ion batteries are used with mobile devices. If a device must be attached to AC power or a USB port to work, replace the battery with one of with the correct DC power jack, appropriate DC voltage level, and current (amperage) equal to or higher than the original power brick.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Conserve mobile device power by adding more RAM, turning off wireless/Bluetooth, configuring power options, reducing screen brightness, and avoiding temperature extremes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ You use ACPI to control power options through BIOS and the operating system. Wake on LAN and Wake on Ring are power features that allow a device to be powered up from a lowered power condition for a specific purpose.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ An AC circuit tester, multimeter, and power supply tester are tools used with power problems.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Power issues include overvoltage conditions such as a surge or spike that can be helped with surge protectors, power conditioners, and UPSs. Power conditioners and UPSs help with undervoltage conditions such as a sag. A UPS is the only device that powers a computer when a blackout occurs.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_165"></a>â¢ Ensure that a surge protector has a Class A rating and adheres to the UL 1449 standard.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ensure that a UPS outputs a sine wave from the battery and can output enough power for attached devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have a Type C or Type A-B-C fire extinguisher around in case of fire.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ In all communications and written documentation, be professional and effective. Use proper capitalization, grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</p>

<h4 id="ch04lev2sec1">Lab 4.1 Performing Maintenance on an Antistatic Wrist Strap</h4>
<p class="objective"><em>Objective</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how to care for and properly use an antistatic wrist strap</p>
<p class="part"><em>Parts</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antistatic wrist strap</p>
<p class="partp">Computer chassis</p>
<p class="partp">Multimeter</p>
<p class="note1"><em>Note</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electrostatic discharge (ESD) has great potential to harm the electronic components inside a computer. Given this fact, it is vitally important that you practice proper ESD precautions when working inside a computer case. One tool you can use to prevent ESD is an antistatic wrist strap. This tool channels any static electricity from your body to the computerâs chassis, where it is dissipated safely.</p>
<p class="procedure"><em>Procedure</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the following procedure and answer the accompanying questions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Examine the wrist strap for any obvious defects such as worn or broken straps, loose grounding lead attachments, dirt or grease buildup, and so on.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> If necessary, remove any dirt or grease buildup from the wrist strap, paying close attention to the electrical contact points such as the wrist contact point, the ground lead attachment point, and the computer chassis attachment clip. Use denatured alcohol to clean these contact points.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> If possible, use a multimeter to check continuity between the wrist contact point and the computer chassis attachment clip. A reading of zero ohms of resistance indicates a good electrical pathway.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue"><strong>How many volts of static electricity does it take to harm a computerâs electrical components?</strong></span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Adjust the wrist strap so it fits snugly yet comfortably around your wrist. Ensure that the wrist contact is in direct contact with your skin, with no clothing, hair, etc., being in the way.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Attach the ground lead to the wrist strap and ensure it snaps securely into place.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Attach the computer chassis attachment clip to a clean metal attachment point on the computer chassis.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Any static electricity generated or attracted by your body will now be channeled through the antistatic wrist strap to the computer chassis, where it will be safely dissipated.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>13.</strong> Touch one meter lead to one end of the paperclip or wire, and touch the other meter lead to the opposite paperclip or wire end. Sometimes it is easier to just lay the meter lead on top of the wire close to the end.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue"><strong>What is the meter reading?</strong></span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>14.</strong> Some meters have the ability to make a sound when a wire is good.
