<p class="noindent">Even though the book has covered many peripherals so far, such as hard drives, optical drives, mice, keyboards, and other USB/IEEE 1394 devices, other peripherals that have unique characteristics and technologies are still to be explored. Two of these technologies are video and printing. Each has associated terminology, concepts, and installation/troubleshooting tips. Letâs explore video first.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec2"><span class="pd_blue">Video Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Video quality is very important to computer users. A display is one of the most expensive computer components. Users usually derive the most gratification from their display, although sound quality is now becoming as important. Technicians must look at video as a subsystem that consists of the display, the electronic circuits that send the display instructions, and the cable that connects them. The electronic video circuits can be on a separate video adapter or built into the motherboard. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig01">Figure 9.1</a> illustrates a computer video subsystem.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec3"><span class="pd_blue">Types of Video Output Devices</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Video output devices such as monitors, projectors, and even TVs are commonly used with desktop and laptop computers. Monitors can be classified several waysâcolor or non-color, analog or digital signals used to produce colors, and the type of video adapter used. The easiest way to classify video output is by the way in which the output is createdâthe technology. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab01">Table 9.1</a> lists some of the most popular display output technologies.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09tab01a.jpg" alt="Image" width="917" height="365"></div>
<p class="indent">Other technologies used in video output include LCoS, SED, and FED. LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon) is similar to DLP (Digital Light Processing) except that it uses liquid crystals instead of mirrors for higher resolutions. SED (surface-conduction electron-emitter display) and FED (field-emission display) technologies are similar: both use electron emitters to energize color phosphor dots to produce an image. The electron emitter used is what makes them different.</p>

<p class="indent">Touch screen displays are used with PCs, tablets, and smartphones. They respond to contact on the screen rather than keyboard or mouse input. They are both an input and output device and are used in situations where information is to be controlled and in public areas such as kiosks in airports, malls, and entrance areas of schools or businesses. Touch screen monitors normally attach to a USB, IEEE 1394, VGA, DVI, or HDMI port, a combination of these ports, or wirelessly. Special drivers and software are used to control the monitor.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several technologies used to manufacture a touch screen display. The two most common ones are resistive and capacitive. Resistive touch screens have a flexible membrane stretched over the face of the display. The membrane contains a special metal oxide coating and has spacers that are used to locate the touched spot on the screen. Resistive touch screens are good in manufacturing or medical areas where the personnel wear gloves. A stylus can also be used with these types of displays.</p>
<p class="indent">Capacitive touch screens are more durable than resistive screens. They respond to a touch or multiple touches on the display and easily detect contact. Most touch screens are the capacitive type. Some mobile devices allow you to calibrate the screen or lock the screen orientation using the <em>Settings</em> option. The screen orientations of mobile devices have been greatly enhanced due to accelerometers and gyroscopes. An <strong><a id="ch09term01" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0006" class="pd_blue">accelerometer</a></strong> detects the screen orientation and adapts what is shown on the screen based on that orientation. A <strong><a id="ch09term27" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0419" class="pd_blue">gyroscope</a></strong> measures and maintains that orientation. These technologies allow you to turn an iPad horizontally to better see a picture in a wide format. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig05">Figure 9.5</a> shows two touch screen devices. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab02">Table 9.2</a> lists some of the different technologies used with touch screen displays.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec4"><a id="page_385"></a><span class="pd_blue">Video Terminology and Theory</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Video has unique terminology associated with it. It is important for a technician to be familiar with video terminology. Letâs start with an important termâresolution. A monitorâs <strong><a id="ch09term46" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0816" class="pd_blue">resolution</a></strong> is the maximum number of pixels on the monitor. Two numbers separated by an Ã (meaning <em>by</em>) describe a monitorâs resolution, such as 1024Ã768 (1024 âbyâ 768). The first number, 1024, is the number of pixels that fit horizontally across the screen. The second number, 768, describes the number of pixels that fit vertically on the screen. The possible monitor resolutions depend on the monitor and the video adapter. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab03">Table 9.3</a> lists important video features with which technicians need to be familiar.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch09tab03"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 9.3.</span> Video features</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09tab03.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="610"></div>
<p class="indent">The monitor <strong><a id="ch09term45" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0806" class="pd_blue">refresh rate</a></strong> is for a specific resolution. If the electron beam has to handle more pixels, it will naturally take longer. Video card capabilities are the main factor in determining what refresh rate the monitor uses, provided the monitor can perform it.</p>
<p class="indent">To set the refresh rate for the display on an XP computer, use the <em>Display</em> Control Panel. Select the <em>Settings</em> tab &gt; <em>Advanced</em> button &gt; <em>Adapter</em> tab &gt; click the <em>Refresh rate</em> down arrow to see a listing of possible settings. The Optimal setting is the default. If you select another setting, click the <em>Apply</em> button and a warning message normally appears. Click the <em>OK</em> button and the monitor changes. A dialog box asks if you want to keep this setting. Selecting <em>No</em> will reset to the default. If the mouse does not work or the mouse pointer does not appear on this screen, just press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/enter.jpg" alt="Image" width="45" height="20"></span>, and the <em>No</em> selection will be accepted.</p>

<p class="notepara">To determine the number of pixels a display has, look at the resolution, such as 1920Ã1200. Multiply the horizontal pixel number (the first numberâ1,920 in this example) by the vertical number of pixels (the second number shown, or 1,200 in this example). The result is the total number of pixels, which in this example is 2,304,000 (approximately 2.3 million pixels).</p>

<p class="notepara">Selecting a higher resolution will make the icons in Windows appear smaller. Use the <em>Display</em> Control Panel to adjust icon size.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">LCD is a video technology used with mobile devices and flat screen displays that are powered by a low-voltage DC power source. They are more reliable and have a longer life span than CRT monitors. The liquid crystals used in these displays are sensitive to temperature changes. That is why they might appear distorted in cold or hot temperatures.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two basic types of LCD: passive matrix and active matrix. The difference between the two lies in how the screen image is created. To see a video on how an LCD works, go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.youtube.com</a> and search for âEngineer Guy LCD monitor teardown.â</p>
<p class="indent">The cheaper of the two, passive matrix, is made up of rows and columns of conductors. Each pixel is located at the intersection of a row and a column. (This is a similar concept to a cell in a spreadsheet.) Current on the grid determines whether a pixel is turned on or off. Each pixel has three cells in a color monitor: one for red, one for green, and one for blue. Another name for passive matrix is STN (supertwist nematic), which is a technology that twists light rays to improve the displayâs contrast. Passive matrix displays are not as bright as active matrix displays.</p>
<p class="indent">Active matrix displays have a transistor for each pixel. The number of transistors depends on the maximum resolution. A 1280Ã800 resolution requires 1,024,000 transistors (1280Ã800 and more are added for color). This technology provides a brighter display (more luminance). Active matrix monitors take more power than passive matrix, but both of them require less power than CRT-based displays. Another name for active matrix monitors is TFT (thin film <a id="page_387"></a>transistor). TFT displays use three transistors per pixel (one for each color). <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab04">Table 9.4</a> lists some common terms and explanations used with LCD/LED displays, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab05">Table 9.5</a> has some of todayâs LCD technologies.</p>

<p class="notepara">You can change the resolution through the <em>Display</em> (XP) or <em>Personalization</em> (Vista/7) Control Panel, but it is best if left to the resolution for which it was designed. Otherwise, the output will not be as sharp as it can be. Use the <em>Display</em> (XP/Vista/7) Control Panel to change the font size if the icons are too small.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">LCDs do not have multiple frequency settings, as CRTs do, nor do they flicker (no beam tracing across and down the screen). The number of pixels on a screen is fixed. Manufacturers use image scalers to change resolution. Pixelation is the effect caused by sending a different resolution out to the display than the display design specifications. The LCD monitor must rely on interpolation or scaling of the output rather than having things displayed in the native resolution (the optimum choice).</p>
<p class="indent">LCDs are found in the desktop and mobile device markets. The desktop monitors that use this technology are called flat panel displays. With flat panel displays, the viewing area is the same as the display measurements (so no trick advertisements). Popular sizes include 14-, 15-, 17-, 18-, 21-, and 23-inch monitors.</p>
<p class="indent">Laptops use LCDs and have a video cable that connects the LCD to the motherboard. Either a CCFL or LED backlight bulb is used on many models so images on the screen can be seen. The CCFL type connects to an inverter. The inverter converts low DC voltage to high AC voltage for the backlight bulb. Screens larger than 15.4 inches may need two CCFL backlight bulbs. An LCD with an LED backlight does not need an inverter. An OLED display doesnât need an inverter or a backlight. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig06">Figure 9.6</a> shows a laptop with a CCFL backlight.</p>

<p class="indent">The laptop display may need to be replaced as part of a repair. When removing a laptop display, always refer to the directions from the computer manufacturer. The following are generic:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Use proper antistatic precautions and remove the screws that hold the screen bezel in place.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Gently pry the plastic bezel that protects the screen edge from the case.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Remove the screen retaining screws.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Gently lift the screen from the case. Be very careful with the connectors. Flip the screen so the back of the screen is visible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Notice the cable that runs up the back of the display.

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Video Ports and Cables</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Flat panel monitors are digital, but some can work with an older analog adapter that has an analog port, such as an AGP port. This is not a good idea because the digital signal output from flat panel monitors must be converted to analog. The issue of colors with the old monitors is no longer relevant since todayâs flat panel monitors use transistors to control colors. Some monitors and TVs also provide USB connectivity. Some LCDs have a USB cable from the computer to the monitor. Many monitors act as a USB hub and provide multiple USB ports.</p>
<p class="indent">With the flat panel monitors, you need an AGP or PCIe adapter that has a DVI (digital video/visual interface) or HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) port. This would be a good time to review the video ports covered in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig08">Figure 9.8</a> shows an adapter with three common video ports (from left to right): HDMI, VGA, and DVI.</p>

<p class="notepara">Using an analog adapter is not recommended for connecting a flat panel display unless the flat panel display accepts analog input. The computer uses digital signals. The digital signals get converted to analog at the video adapter, it is sent to the monitor as analog, and then the monitor has to convert it back to digital for the display output.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">With VGA ports, the analog video signals are sent using a VGA cable. The VGA standards did not specify a cable length maximum, but with higher resolutions, a higher quality cable is required. DVI, which uses digital video signals, is a similar situation. The standard does not specify cable lengths, but you sometimes have to install a DVI repeater (booster) for longer distances used with higher resolutions. Note that older DVI ports were not designed to output to some of the newer display formats (no matter what cable you use). With DisplayPorts and HDMI ports, cabling standards do exist, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig09">Figure 9.9</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Multiple Displays</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A popular business and home display option is to have two displays connected to the same computer. Another option would be to have a laptop with an external monitor attached, and both the laptop display and the external monitor display are active. To have two monitors connected to a single computer, you have several methods of configuration:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the two video ports on the motherboard (not common).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the integrated motherboard port and buy a video card with one video port. (This is the cheapest solution, but the motherboard might disable the integrated video port automatically.)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Buy a video card that has two video ports (best option).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Buy two video cards. (Usually the motherboard has one expansion slot for a video card, and that means using an older and slower technology expansion slot for the second video card.)</p>
<p class="indent">Once Windows recognizes the second monitor (two monitors appear in Device Manager), in Windows XP, use the <em>Appearance and Themes</em> &gt; <em>Display</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Settings</em> tab &gt; click <em>Identify</em> so that a large number appears on each monitor. Click the monitor icons and drag them on the screen to arrange the display. In Windows 7 use the <em>Appearance and Personalization</em> Control Panel &gt; select the <em>Adjust screen resolution</em> link &gt; locate the <em>Multiple <a id="page_393"></a>displays</em> drop down menu to see the desktop options. Note that if the <em>Multiple displays</em> option is not shown, Windows does not recognize the second monitor. Troubleshoot hardware connectivity, monitor input mode if the monitor has multiple input ports, and verify system BIOS options. An exercise at the end of this chapter demonstrates this. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig11">Figure 9.11</a> shows an adapter with two DVI connectors that could be used for this purpose. Notice how the card also has an S-video port for a connection to a TV or other video output.</p>

<p class="indent">Another variation that some network administrators, technicians, other people, or businesses want is the ability to use the same monitor (and sometimes mouse and keyboard) for two or more different computers. This is best done through a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) switch, which allows at least one mouse, one keyboard, and one video output to be used by two or more computers. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig12">Figure 9.12</a> shows a KVM switch.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec8"><a id="page_394"></a><span class="pd_blue">Projectors</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Monitors, cameras, TVs, and web cams are not the only peripherals that connect to computer video ports. Projectors are becoming common devices, and technicians must be familiar with them. A projector allows what is being displayed on a computer to be projected onto a larger screen. A projector has similar connections to those described for video cards. Cables that convert between the different formats are available. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig13">Figure 9.13</a> shows some of the connectors available on a projector. A projector sometimes connects to other audio and video devices besides computers, such as a document camera, speakers, optical disc players, and smart boards. The VGA in and out ports are two of the most common ports seen on a projector for connecting video. S-video is also quite common. The newer projectors have DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec9"><span class="pd_blue">Monitor Preventive Maintenance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is simple to perform preventive maintenance on a monitor. Static builds up on the face of a monitor, and the screen attracts dust and dirt the way a television does. Antistatic cleaning wipes are available at computer and office supply stores. Some monitors also have a button on the front that, when pushed, removes static electricity from the front of the monitor.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_396"></a>A CRT monitor can also be cleaned with a soft dampened cloth and mild household detergent, glass cleaner, or isopropyl alcohol. Do not allow any liquid to get near the edge of a CRT. The liquid can seep inside the monitor case and cause damage. If using a CRT cleaning spray or glass cleaner, spray the cleaner on the cloth, not on the monitor. If the monitor has a nonglare screen or any type of special coating, see the manufacturerâs instructions for cleaning it.</p>

<p class="notepara">A CRT monitor holds 20,000 or more volts (depending on the monitor size and components). Voltage can still be present after the power is turned off. Most technicians who work on monitors have special training in working on high-voltage equipment.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">LCDs can be cleaned with wipes specifically designed for LCDs. Also, a soft cloth dampened with water or a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water can be used to wipe an LCD. Do not use glass cleaner to clean LCDs, and never apply liquid directly to a monitor of any type. On a laptop, ensure that the display is dry before closing the laptop lid. Mobile device screens can be wiped with a soft cloth. Do not use any type of liquid on a touch screen.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec10"><span class="pd_blue">Monitor Energy Efficiency</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A monitorâs life span is normally 30,000 to 60,000 hours. The heat generated inside a monitor can reduce the life span of the monitorâs components. Three things contribute to display power utilization:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SizeâThe larger the screen, the more power used.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ TechnologyâLCDs require less power than plasma displays. LCDs that use LEDs for backlighting require less power than displays that use CCFLs. OLED monitors use even less power.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SettingsâSettings include brightness (brighter settings require more power) and power saver modes.</p>
<p class="indent">Some monitors have energy-conservation capabilities. These green monitors have software that reduces the power, leaving only enough to allow the monitor to be reactivated to a usable state quickly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produced ENERGY STAR guidelines to which many monitor manufacturers adhere. According to ENERGY STAR, displays that meet their criteria (<a href="http://www.energystar.gov/">http://www.energystar.gov</a>) are 20 percent more efficient than other displays.</p>
<p class="indent">The following are some best practices for monitor energy efficiency:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the power switch to turn off a monitor when you are finished using it for the day.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the Windows <em>Power Options</em> Control Panel to enable Sleep mode for a monitor after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ On a laptop, adjust the contrast or brightness level to a lower one to prolong the life of the backlight.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ On a laptop, turn off Windows Aero to conserve power and battery life.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When buying a new laptop, consider one that uses an LED backlight instead of CCFL. In addition to the power savings, this technology can have better color accuracy.</p>
<p class="indent">To modify the power-saving features, use the <em>Display</em> (XP)/<em>Power Options</em> (Vista/7) Control Panel. In XP, click the <em>Screen Saver</em> tab and click the <em>Settings</em> button to display the <em>Power Management Properties</em> window. In Vista/7, select the <em>Change plan settings</em> link.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec11"><a id="page_397"></a><span class="pd_blue">Privacy</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the past, when monitors did not have fast refresh rates, screen savers were very important. A screen saver changes the image on the monitor constantly to keep any particular image from burning into the screen. With old monitors, if an image stayed on the screen for an extended period of time, an imprint of the image was left on the screen permanently. Todayâs monitors have high enough refresh rates so that screen savers are not necessary, but now they are an entertainment art form. LCDs use a different technology than CRTs and have never needed screen savers.</p>
<p class="indent">Screen savers can provide password protection that may be important to some users. With the password screen saver enabled, a user can leave his or her work area, and no one can access the computer without the screen saver password.</p>
<p class="indent">In Windows XP, to enable the screen saver, use the <em>Display</em> Control Panel. In Vista/7, use the <em>Personalization</em> Control Panel along with the <em>Display settings</em> link. Click the <em>Screen Saver</em> tab and click the <em>Screen Saver</em> down arrow to display an options list. The <em>Blank Screen</em> option takes the least amount of memory and does not use CPU time. Another resource saver is to remove the displayâs wallpaper option (also found through the <em>Display</em> Control Panel).</p>
<p class="indent">As a display option, antiglare filters can be used. An antiglare filter helps in certain lighting environments and when outside light affects the display. Antiglare filters are also available for mobile devices and smartphones.</p>
<p class="indent">Another display add-on is a privacy screen. A <strong><a id="ch09term43" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0764" class="pd_blue">privacy filter</a></strong>, also known as a privacy screen, distorts the display output for anyone except for the person looking directly at the screen. This is good for managers and people who have confidential business matters on their screen when someone might walk up to or by the desk.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">Video Adapters</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Using millions of colors, motion, sound, and video combined, a computerâs video subsystem has made dramatic technological advances. The video adapter controls most of the display output. Video adapters use the PCI, AGP, or PCIe interface. The bus connects the video card to the processor. The processor accepts data in 16-, 32-, or 64-bit chunks depending on the processor and the bus interface. One of the challenges of interfacing video is finding a good video adapter that uses a high-performance system architecture such as PCIe.</p>
<p class="indent">On the motherboard, the processor and the chipset are responsible for how quickly data travels to and from the video adapter. Such things as upgrading the chipset (motherboard), the processor, or the video adapter to a faster interface, speed up video transfer to the monitor. However, special features on the video adapter can also speed up video transfer.</p>
<p class="indent">Some video adapters have their own processor called the <strong><a id="ch09term26" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0414" class="pd_blue">GPU</a></strong> (graphics processing unit). Other names include video processor, video coprocessor, or video accelerator). The GPU assists in video communication between the video adapter and the system processor. GPUs are also found in gaming systems, smartphones, tablets, and laptops. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig16">Figure 9.16</a> shows a video adapter with a video processor. The processor has a fan installed on top of the GPU. GPUs commonly have fans and/or heat sinks attached. Look back to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig08">Figure 9.8</a> to see a different view of the GPU.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.16.</span> Video adapter with GPU</p>
<p class="indent">AGP video cards sometimes required extra power and could use a Molex power connector. PCIe cards may require either a 6- or 8-pin connector from the power supply. The 6-pin cable can provide an additional 75 watts of power, while the 8-pin cable can provide an additional 150 watts. A PCIe video card could require multiple power cables as well.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_398"></a>Some video processors are 64- or 128-bit processors. Many users (and technicians) have a hard time understanding how a 128-bit video processor works in a 32-bit or 64-bit expansion slot. The 64 or 128 bits refers to the number of bits the video adapterâs accelerator chip accepts at one time. The 64-bit (or higher) video processor controls many video functions on the video adapter otherwise handled by the motherboard processor. Anytime information is processed on the adapter rather than the motherboard processor, performance is faster. When signals pass to the motherboard processor through an expansion slot, performance slows. Most video cards today contain a GPU because video is one of the biggest bottlenecks in a computer system.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec13"><span class="pd_blue">Specialized Video Cards</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A specialized use of video is with TV tuner cards and video capture cards. A <strong><a id="ch09term52" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1013" class="pd_blue">TV tuner card</a></strong> allows TV signals to be brought into the computer and output to the monitor. Some TV tuner cards have the ability to record video. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig17">Figure 9.17</a> shows a photo of a TV tuner card. Notice how the card connectors are different. The two protruding connectors allow a coaxial cable connection.</p>

Not all video capture cards support audio. Video surveillance systems sometimes use video capture cards.</p>
<p class="indent">Another specialized use of video is SLI (scalable link interface) from NVIDIA. SLI links two or more PCIe video cards to share processing on graphics-intensive operations. AMDâs CrossFire and CrossFireX performs similarly by allowing multiple GPUs to be used cooperatively in the same computer. Note that the system chipset must be compatible with SLI or CrossFire technologies and you will probably need a power connector from the power supply for each video card.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec14"><span class="pd_blue">Video Memory</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most important functions of a video processor is to transfer data to and from a video adapterâs memory. Memory chips on the video adapter can be regular DRAM chips (including DDR2 and DDR3).</p>
<p class="indent">The objective is to get data in and out of the video card memory chips as quickly as possible for a reasonable cost. The adapter must handle a large amount of data due to the increasing number of pixels and colors displayed. Ample, fast memory on a video card allows higher resolutions and more colors to appear on the screen, without the screen appearing to flicker.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: How much video memory?</span></p>
<p class="notepara">The amount of video adapter memory determines the number of colors available at a specific resolution.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">All parts of the video subsystem must work together to get a clear picture on the screen. A very expensive video adapter with 16 trillion megabytes of memory connected to a monitor with a poor dot pitch will display a distorted picture on the screen. An expensive monitor connected to a PCI video adapter with only 256KB of memory will not provide the fastest refresh rates, and the monitor will appear to flicker as a result. The adapter needs to contain enough memory to sustain the number of colors at the specific resolution at which the user must work. A technician cannot perform magic on poorly matched video components. The only solution is to upgrade the weak link.</p>
<p class="indent">Memory on a video card stores screen information as a snapshot of what appears on the screen. The video adapter manufacturer determines the maximum amount of video memory. Some manufacturers make video adapters that are not upgradable. Check the adapterâs documentation before making a purchase or recommendation.</p>
<p class="indent">To determine the amount of video memory an adapter needs, multiply the total number of pixels (the resolution) by the number of bits needed to produce a specific number of colors. Different combinations of 16 1s and 0s create 65,536 (64K) possible combinations as 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536. For example, take a system that needs 65,536 colors at the resolution 1024Ã768. To determine the minimum video memory necessary, multiply 16 (the number of bits needed for 64K of colors) by 1024 by 768 (the resolution). The result, 12,582,912, is the number of bits needed to handle the combination of 64K colors at 1024Ã768. Divide the bits by 8 for the number of <em>bytes</em> needed. This is the minimum amount of memory needed on the video card: 12,582,912 . 8 = 1,572,864, or 1.5MB. The user needs more video memory if more colors, a higher resolution, or video motion is desired.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab07">Table 9.7</a> lists the number of bits required for different color options.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_400"></a>Some video cards offer 32-bit color. The extra bits are used for color control and special effects, such as animation and game effects. Determining the amount of video memory may have seemed confusing; an exercise at the end of this chapter provides practice for configuring different scenarios. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab08">Table 9.8</a> lists the minimum amounts of video memory needed for specific configurations.</p>

<p class="indent">If 2-D or 3-D graphics are being used, the calculations shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab08">Table 9.8</a> can be used as a starting point, but more memory is needed. For 2-D graphics, multiply the answer by 16 more bits. For 3-D graphics, multiply the final number by 48 bits. Then divide by 8 to find out how many bytes.</p>
<p class="indent">Video RAM is RAM that is used for video exclusively. When this RAM is not enough, motherboard RAM is used. When motherboard RAM is being used in addition to video card RAM, the amount of motherboard RAM being used is known as <strong><a id="ch09term47" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0890" class="pd_blue">shared system memory</a></strong>, or shared video memory. You see this when you examine the video display properties. Some systems allow customization through system BIOS or a special control panel provided by the video adapter manufacturer. Common system BIOS options to control shared system memory include AGP Aperture Size and Onboard Video Memory Size. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig18">Figure 9.18</a> shows a video card that has 512MB of RAM installed on the video card (Dedicated Video Memory).

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec15"><a id="page_401"></a><span class="pd_blue">Installing a Video Adapter</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first step in installing a video adapter is to do your homework:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Make sure you have the correct interface type and an available motherboard slot. PCIe and AGP are the most common.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Gather tools, if needed. If a tool is needed, it will be a screwdriver to remove the slot-retaining bracket and to re-insert the screw that holds the adapter.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Download the latest drivers for the video adapter.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Make sure the adapter has a driver for the operating system you are using.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Ensure that the power supply can supply enough power when the adapter is added. Some high-end video adapters require a PCIe 6- or 8-pin or AGP Molex power connector. Some PCIe cards can use a power cable adapter that converts two Molex power connectors to the PCIe power connector. Other video cards can receive adequate power (up to 75 watts) through the PCIe expansion slot.</p>

<p class="notepara">When you install a new video adapter, if it does not work, disable the onboard video port by accessing system BIOS Setup.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Before installing the adapter, power off the computer and unplug it. For best results and to prevent component damage, use an antistatic wrist strap. Access the motherboard by removing a side panel or removing the computerâs cover. Remove any previously installed video adapters (if performing an upgrade) by removing the screw. Use both hands and lift the board upward; you may need to rock the board slightly from side to side to remove it. If no video adapters are installed, remove the retaining screw and remove the expansion slot cover. Place the retaining screw to the side.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes with a tower computer, it is best to lay the computer on its side to insert the video adapter properly. Line up the video adapterâs metal connectors with the interface slot. Push the adapter into the expansion slot. Make sure the adapter is flush with the expansion slot. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig19">Figure 9.19</a> shows a video adapter being installed in a tower. Notice that the technician is observing proper ESD procedures. Also notice that a cable from the motherboard S/PDIF out connector attaches to this video card for audio output. Make sure sections of the adapterâs gold connectors are not showing and that the card is not skewed. Re-install the retaining screw, if necessary. Connect the monitor to the external video connector. Power on the monitor and computer.</p>

<p class="indent">A video adapter usually has a set of drivers or software to enable the adapter to work to its full potential. Individual software drivers from the manufacturer provide system compatibility and performance boosts. The Internet provides a wonderful way for technicians to obtain current video drivers from adapter manufacturers. Be sure to use the proper video driver for the operating system. Always follow the adapter manufacturerâs instructions for installing drivers.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec16"><a id="page_402"></a><span class="pd_blue">Troubleshooting Video</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As with other troubleshooting, when troubleshooting a video problem, check simple solutions first. Do not assume anything! Verify that the monitorâs power light is on. If it is not, check the power cable connectors, surge strip, and wall outlet. Verify that the brightness and contrast settings have not been changed. Laptop users can use the appropriate <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/fn.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="20"></span> key and appropriate keystroke to adjust brightness/contrast. Check or disable power-saving features while youâre troubleshooting. Double-check the monitor cable connected to the video port. Ask the user if any new or upgraded software or hardware has recently been installed, including an operating system automatic update.</p>

<p class="notepara">To troubleshoot a laptop display, connect an external monitor to the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/fn.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="20"></span> video port. Use the key and appropriate keystroke to enable the external monitor port. If the external monitor works, the video circuits are fine. The laptop display has an issue. A dim or black display is commonly the DC-to-AC inverter or the backlight.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">In the video subsystem, if a piece of hardware is defective, then it is the monitor, adapter, motherboard port, or cable. If replacement is necessary, always do the easiest solution first. Replace the monitor with one that is working.</p>
<p class="indent">Many video problems involve a software driver or improperly configured settings problem. Anything wrong on the display can be a result of a bad video driver, an incompatible driver, an incorrect driver, or an incompatible system BIOS version. The best way to be sure is to download the exact driver for the monitor and the display adapter/port from the Internet or obtain it from the manufacturer. Some troubleshooting tips related to video follow. Remember, these are only suggestions. Research and contact, if necessary, the monitor, motherboard, or video adapter manufacturer for specific instructions on troubleshooting its equipment.</p>
<p class="indent">Common video problems include the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Bent or broken video pins cause color shifts and/or image distortion. Carefully examine the monitorâs cable ends. The cable may appear to correctly plug into the connector even when the pins are bent and do not fit properly into the connector. If you find one or more bent pins, carefully use needle-nose pliers to gently straighten the pins.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you suspect a video driver problem, boot to Safe Mode, which uses a standard (generic) VGA driver to see if the problem is resolved and to determine whether it is a software driver problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the CRT screen appears distorted around the edges of the monitor or the color appears distorted, check for any other equipment, such as other monitors, speakers, magnets, and fluorescent lighting, that might cause interference with the monitor. Move the monitor from its current location to see if the situation improves or if the problem goes away.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Another possible problem with color distortion is CRT magnetization from an outside source. Degaussing circuits neutralize a magnetic field. Some monitors have degaussing controls built into them, so try letting a monitorâs internal degaussing circuits fix the problem. Turn on the monitor and computer for one minute. Then turn off the monitor. Leave the monitor off for 30 minutes. Then turn the monitor on again for 1 minute, followed by turning it off and leaving it off for 30 minutes. Continue to do this for several cycles.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not use a degausser on an LCD monitor. On LCD monitors, use the vendor-provided software to make adjustments for distortion.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a screen has intermittent problems or poor quality, lower the refresh rate or update the video driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Set a laptop to the native resolution (the resolution for which the LCD was made).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a cursor appears momentarily before the computer boots and then nothing is displayed or a distorted display appears, check for a video driver problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_403"></a>â¢ A laptop may start normally, but its screen may not display the Windows startup screen. Sometimes a faint image seems to be evident or no image is displayed, but you can hear the hard drive. The inverter most likely needs to be replaced. This is a commonly replaced component in an LCD.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a laptop sometimes flickers or the display appears and then disappears if you move the laptop lid, this is usually a result of a bad or poorly connected video cable. Horizontal or vertical stripes on the screen are also signs of this problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you change the resolution or number of colors and the output is distorted, change the settings back to the original settings, if possible, reboot to Safe Mode or use the Last Known Good Configuration boot option, and reduce the resolution or number of colors.</p>

<p class="notepara">Most likely this is because the backlight bulb is faulty. Otherwise, the problem is the DC-to-AC inverter. Connect an external monitor to the laptop external video port. If the external monitor works, most likely the backlight bulb is the culprit.</p>

<p class="notepara">Check the laptop close switch that is located in the main part of the laptop, close to the back and near to where the display attaches to the laptop. Check the power management settings, which can be configured to go into hibernate, sleep, or standby if the laptop is closed. Also check the video cable from the motherboard to the display.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Monitor flickering is normally caused by an incorrect refresh rate setting, which can be changed: Windows 7 <em>Display</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Change display settings</em> &gt; <em>Advanced settings</em> &gt; <em>Adapter</em> tab. It can also be caused by proximity to other video devices, speakers, refrigerators, and fluorescent lighting. In such a situation, move the monitor or offending device.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows is not supposed to hang during the boot process because of video driver incompatibility. Instead, the operating system loads a default video driver. If video is a problem while working in Windows, boot to Safe Mode or use the Last Known Good Configuration boot option and then load the correct driver. You could also use the driver rollback option if a new driver has just been installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a BSOD (blue screen of death) appears, try rebooting the computer. You can also boot to Safe Mode and reload a video driver from there.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the monitor settings to verify that the monitor detection is accurate. In Windows XP, use the <em>Display</em> Control Panelâs <em>Settings</em> tab. In Vista/7, use the <em>Personalization</em> or <em>Display</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Display settings</em> &gt; <em>Settings</em> tab.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If nothing outputs after you have installed a video adapter, check the following: card inserted fully into the slot, connectors not properly attached, adapter not supported by the motherboard, auxiliary power not attached to adapter, insufficient power from the power supply, and improper driver installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Any monitor that wonât come out of power saver mode might need one of the following done: (1) update the video driver, (2) flash the system BIOS, (3) check the BIOS power settings to ensure that ACPI is enabled so Windows settings can be used, or (4) determine whether the problem is being caused by the monitor or the port. Connect a different monitor. If the video port is built into the motherboard, disable it through BIOS and insert a video card; otherwise, replace the video adapter to see if the port/adapter is causing the problem. Most likely it is a driver/Windows/BIOS ACPI setting problem.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec17"><span class="pd_blue">Printers Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Printers are a difficult subject to cover because many different models exist (of course, that can be said about any peripheral); but the principles are the same for different categories of printers. The best way to begin is to look at what printers have in common. All printers have three subsystems: (1) the paper transport subsystem, (2) the marking subsystem, and (3) the print engine subsystem. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab09">Table 9.9</a> describes these subsystems.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch09tab09"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 9.9.</span> Printer subsystems</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09tab09.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="337"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_405"></a>Keep the three printer subsystems in mind when setting up a printer and troubleshooting it. Knowing how a specific type of printer places an image on the paper also helps when troubleshooting the printer.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec18"><span class="pd_blue">Printer Ports</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Printers connect to parallel (IEEE 1284), serial, infrared, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), Ethernet, or USB ports. They can also connect through a wireless network or using wireless USB. Most printers attach to a PC by using the wired USB port. With USB printers, the USB host controller (built into the motherboard or on an adapter) powers up and queries all USB devices about what type of data transfer they want to perform. Printers use bulk transfer on the USB, which means data is sent in 64-byte sections. The USB host controller also assigns to each USB a device so that the host controller can track them. Even though a USB port can provide power to smaller devices, a USB printer normally has its own power source.</p>
<p class="indent">USB is a good solution for printers because it is fast, and there are usually several ports availableâor a hub can be added to provide more ports. USB uses only one interrupt for the devices connected to the bus.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec19"><span class="pd_blue">Networked Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many home users and almost all businesses use networked printers (printers that can be used by more than one computer). Printers can be networked using the following methods:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A printer that is connected to a computer can be shared or made available to other computers through the Windows operating system. The other computers must be networked in some way.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A printer can have a network card integrated into it or installed that allows it to participate as a network device. This includes wireless networks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A printer can attach to a device called an external <strong><a id="ch09term39" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0761" class="pd_blue">print server</a></strong> (similar to attaching a printer to a computer), and the print server attaches to the network.</p>
<p class="indent">A networked printer can reduce costs. Laser printers can be expensiveâespecially ones that produce high-speed, high-volume, high-quality color output. Buying one printer and allowing users to access it from their individual desktops can be cost-effective. It also reduces the amount of office or home space needed. Network printing is a viable alternative to using a computerâs USB port.</p>
<p class="indent">A print server connects to a network and allows any computer that is also connected to a network to print to it if the networks are the same or connected to one another. Some print servers can handle both wired and wireless connections. In this case, the print server attaches to a network switch, and a network wireless router or wireless access point attaches to the same switch. Any PCs (wired or wireless) can print to the printer that attaches to the print server. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig20">Figure 9.20</a> illustrates this concept.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.20.</span> Wireless and wired print server connectivity</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec20"><span class="pd_blue">Wireless Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A PC can connect wirelessly to a printer using different methods: (1) The print server to which the printer connects can have wireless capabilities, and wireless PCs can connect to the printer through the print server (as previously described and illustrated); (2) the printer can have a wireless NIC (network interface card) installed or attached via a USB port; or (3) the printer can have integrated Bluetooth capabilities or a Bluetooth adapter attached via a USB port. Printers with wireless capabilities are common, but the wireless adapter may have to be purchased separately. Refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14">Chapters 14</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15">15</a> for more information on wireless networking theory and issues related to installing wireless devices.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec21"><span class="pd_blue">Categories of Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Printers can be categorized according to how they put an image on paper. Printer categories are impact (otherwise known as dot matrix), inkjet, laser, and thermal. There are more types, but these make up the majority of printers used in the workplace and home. Computer users normally choose a printer based on the type of printing they need to do. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab10">Table 9.10</a> describes the four major printer categories.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09tab10.jpg" alt="Image" width="917" height="514"></div>
<p class="indent">Each of the four basic printer types is discussed in greater detail in the following sections. The theory of operation for each printer type mainly concerns the marking subsystem.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec22"><a id="page_407"></a><span class="pd_blue">Impact Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Impact printers are frequently called dot matrix printers because of the way they create an image on paper. Such a printer has a <strong><a id="ch09term41" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0760" class="pd_blue">printhead</a></strong> that holds tiny wires called <strong><a id="ch09term42" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0763" class="pd_blue">printwires</a></strong>. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig21">Figure 9.21</a> shows an Oki Data Americas, Inc., printhead. The printwires are shown on the front of the printhead. The printwires can get out of alignment and produce misformed characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch09fig21"></a><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09fig21.jpg" alt="Image" width="459" height="383"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.21.</span> Impact printer printhead</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_408"></a>The wires individually strike a ribbon hard enough to create a dot on the paper. The dots collectively form letters or images. The speed at which the printhead can place characters on a page is its <strong><a id="ch09term12" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0179" class="pd_blue">cps</a></strong> (characters per second) rating. The number of printwires in the printhead determines the quality of printing; the more printwires, the better the print quality. The most common printwires are 9, 18, and 24. The 24-pin printers can print NLQ (near letter quality) output.</p>
<p class="indent">Each printwire connects to a solenoid coil. When current flows to the printwire, a magnetic field causes the wire to move away from the printhead and out a tiny hole. The printwire impacts a ribbon, creating a dot on the paper. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig22">Figure 9.22</a> shows an impact printer printhead. To show the individual printwires, the casing that covers the printwires has been removed from the illustration.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: One direction is not a problem</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Most impact printers print bidirectionally. When the printhead gets too hot, the printer prints only in the left-to-right direction. This is normal.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Each wire connects to a spring that pulls the printwire back inside the printhead. The images created are nothing more than a series of dots on the page. Dot matrix printers are also called impact printers because the printwire springs out of the printhead. The act of the printwire coming out of the printhead is called pin firing. The impact of the printer physically striking the ribbon, which in turn touches the paper, causes impact printers to be noisy.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the printwire impacts the ribbon, one of the most common points of failure with impact printers is the printhead. It can be expensive to replace printheads frequently in a high-usage situation; however, refurbished printheads work fine and are available at a reduced price. The companies that refurbish them usually replace the faulty wires and test the printhead thoroughly.</p>
<p class="indent">Impact printers are the workhorses of printers. One advantage of an impact printer is that it can print multiple-part forms such as invoices, purchase orders, shipping documents, and wide forms. Multiple-part forms print easily on an impact printer because the printer impacts the paper so hard. The maximum number of multiple copies each printer handles depends on the printer model. Laser and inkjet printers cannot produce multiple-part forms. They can only make multiple copies of the same document.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not stack things on top of any printer, especially an impact printer. The printhead gets hot, and you should not add to the heat by stacking things on top of the printer. Keep a printer in a cool environment to avoid overheating. If a printer is used continuously, thus keeping the printhead hot, consider purchasing a second printer to handle the workload.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec23"><a id="page_409"></a><span class="pd_blue">Inkjet Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Inkjet printers are much quieter than impact printers. An inkjet printer also has a printhead, but the inkjetâs printhead does not have metal pins that fire out from the printhead. Instead, the inkjetâs printhead has many tiny nozzles that squirt ink onto the paper. Each nozzle is smaller than a strand of human hair. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig23">Figure 9.23</a> shows a photo of an inkjet print cartridge. Notice the three rows of nozzles on the cartridge on the left.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch09fig23"></a><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09fig23.jpg" alt="Image" width="1000" height="765"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.23.</span> Inkjet print cartridge</p>
<p class="indent">One great thing about some inkjet printers is that the printhead includes the nozzles and the reservoir for ink. When the ink runs out, you replace the entire printhead. The inkjet printer printhead is known as the print, or ink, cartridge. An ink cartridge has up to 6,000 nozzles instead of the 9-, 18-, or 24-pin configuration of the impact printer. This is one reason why the inkjet quality is preferable to an impact printer. Replacing the printhead, one of the most frequently used parts, keeps repair costs low but consumable costs are high. Two alternatives are for the manufacturers to use (1) a combination of a disposable printhead that is replaced as needed and a disposable ink tank, or (2) a replaceable printhead similar to the impact printer.</p>
<p class="indent">Inkjet printers, also called bubble jet or thermal printers, use thermal (heat) technology to place the ink on the paper. Each print nozzle attaches to a small ink chamber that attaches to a larger ink reservoir. A small amount of ink inside the chamber heats to a boiling temperature. Once the ink boils, a vapor bubble forms. As the bubble gets hotter, it expands and goes out through the print cartridgeâs nozzle onto the paper. The size of the ink droplet is approximately two ten-thousandths (.0002) of an inch, smaller than the width of a human hair. As the small ink chamber cools down, suction occurs. The suction pulls more ink into the ink chamber for the production of the next ink droplet.</p>
<p class="indent">An alternative for producing the ink dots is to use piezo-electric technology, which uses pressure, not heat, to eject the ink onto the paper. Some companies use this technology to obtain high resolutions. <strong><a id="ch09term19" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0270" class="pd_blue">DPI</a></strong> is the number of dots per inch a printer outputs. The higher the dpi, the better the quality of inkjet or laser printer output. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig24">Figure 9.24</a> shows the basic principle of how an inkjet printer works.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_410"></a><a id="ch09fig24"></a><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/09fig24.jpg" alt="Image" width="767" height="413"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.24.</span> How an inkjet printer works</p>
<p class="indent">Most inkjet printers have different modes of printing. The draft mode uses the least amount of ink, and the NLQ (near letter quality) mode uses the most ink. The quality produced by an inkjet printer is equal to or sometimes higher than that of a laser printer, and inkjet printers print in color, whereas many laser printers print only in monochrome (black and white).</p>

<p class="notepara">Many inkjet printers now show their dpi as <em>optimize</em>d dpi. Optimized dpi does not describe how many drops of liquid are in an inch but in a specific grid.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Color inkjet printers usually have a black cartridge for text printing and a separate color cartridge or separate cartridges for colored ink. Buying an inkjet printer that uses a single cartridge for all colors is cheaper on the initial printer purchase but more expensive in the long run. The black ink usually runs out much more quickly than the colored ink. Users should buy an inkjet model with separate cartridges for black ink and colored ink.</p>
<p class="indent">There are some alternatives to inkjet technology. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab11">Table 9.11</a> outlines four of them.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_411"></a>Inkjet printers are perfect for small businesses, home computer users, and individual computer office work. Some models of inkjet printers include faxing, scanning, copying, and printing capabilities. For higher output, a laser printer is more appropriate. A drawback to using ink is that sometimes the ink smears. Ink manufacturers vary greatly in how they respond to this problem. If the paper gets wet, some inkjet output becomes messy. The ink also smears if you touch the printed page before the ink dries. The ink can also soak into the paper and bleed down the paper. Using good-quality paper and ink in the ink cartridge helps with this particular problem. Some manufacturers have a printer operation mode that slows down the printing to give the ink time to dry or a heating process to prevent smudges. See this chapterâs section on printer supplies for more information on choosing the correct paper for different printers.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec24"><span class="pd_blue">Laser Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The term <em>laser</em> stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. A laser printer uses a process similar to a copy machineâs electrophotographic process. Before describing how a laser printer works, identifying the major parts inside the printer helps to understand how it works. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig25">Figure 9.25</a> shows a side view of a laser printer with a toner cartridge installed.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.25.</span> Laser printer parts</p>
<p class="indent">The computer sends 1s and 0s out the port and down the cable to the printer. Because data gets written to a laser drum by placing âdotsâ close togetherâsimilarly to how an inkjet printer squirts dots close togetherâthe data must be prepared before the seven steps of getting the data onto the paper begin. The processing is the preparatory step, where the data is rasterized or converted into dots. Data transmits either through an array of LEDs or through a laser beam. The light beam strikes the photosensitive drum located inside the toner cartridge. Laser toner particles are attracted to the drum. The paper feeds through and the toner transfers to the paper. The toner is then fused or melted onto the paper. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09tab12">Table 9.12</a> summarizes the seven step laser printing process.</p>

Users not familiar with laser printers sometimes complain about this noise, but it is a normal function of a laser printer.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Every laser printer that uses the seven-phase process is known as a write-black laser printer. These laser printers produce a black dot everyplace the beam touches the drum. Most laser printers use write-black technology. Write-white laser printers reverse the process, and the toner attracts everywhere the light beam does <em>not</em> touch the drum surface. Write-black printers print finer details, but write-white laser printers can produce darker shades of black areas.</p>

<p class="notepara">Toner melts when warmed; small toner spills outside the printer can be wiped using a cold, damp cloth.

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec25"><span class="pd_blue">Thermal Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Thermal printers are used in a lot of retail establishments and at kiosks, gas pumps, trade shows, and basically anywhere someone needs a little printer to print a small document such as a receipt. IT staff commonly have to service thermal printers. A thermal printer uses special paper that is sensitive to heat. A printhead has closely spaced heating elements that appear as closely spaced dots on the heat sensitive paper. A <strong><a id="ch09term22" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0362" class="pd_blue">feed assembly</a></strong> is used to move the thermal paper through the printer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig29">Figure 9.29</a> shows examples of thermal printers.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec26"><span class="pd_blue">Paper</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The type of paper used in a printer can affect its performance and cause problems. Impact printers are the most forgiving because a mechanism physically impacts the paper. On the other hand, inkjet printers spray ink onto the paper, so the quality of paper determines how well the ink adheres. If the paper absorbs too much of the ink, the printout appears faded. For a laser printer, how well the paper heats and absorbs the toner also affects the printed output. Paper is a big factor in the quality of how long the ink lasts and the quality of print produced.</p>
<p class="indent">Erasable-bond paper does not work well in laser printers because the paper does not allow the toner to fuse properly. Paper is rated in pounds (abbreviated lb) and shown as 20lb or 20#. A higher number indicates heavier, thicker paper. Many types of paper are available for inkjet and laser printers: transparency paper for overhead projectors, high-gloss paper, water-resistant inkjet paper, fabric paper, greeting cards, labels, recycled paper, and so on. Recycled paper may cause printer jams and can produce lower print quality.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_417"></a>The highest-quality paper available does not work well if the surrounding area has too much humidity. Humidity is paperâs worst enemy. Humidity causes paper to stick together and reduces the paperâs strength, which causes feed problems. Paper affected by humidity is sometimes noticeable because of the lumpy look it gives the paper. If you detect damaged paper, discard and recycle it immediately. For best printing results, keep paper stored in a non-humid storage area and fan the paper before you insert it into the printerâs bin.</p>
<p class="indent">Paper options also relate to printers. Some impact printers allow you to remove the normal paper feeder and attach a tractor-feed option that allows continuous paper to be fed through the printer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig30">Figure 9.30</a> shows how the paper with holes on both sides feeds through the impact printer. Both impact and inkjet printers have special feeders or you move a slide bar to feed envelopes or unusual sized paper through. Laser printers sometimes ship with additional trays and must be configured for this option. Any printer that has non-standard paper installed, must be configured for that paper size using the <em>Printers and Faxes</em> (XP), <em>Printers</em> (Vista), or <em>Devices and Printers</em> (7) Control Panel. Laser printers normally allow manual feeding and have a front cover that allows paper, labels, transparencies, and other unusual sizes and types of paper to be used.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec27"><span class="pd_blue">Refilling Cartridges, Re-inking Ribbons, and Recycling Cartridges</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Much controversy exists about re-inking impact printer ribbons, refilling inkjet cartridges, and buying remanufactured laser cartridges. Many people who are concerned about the environment recycle their cartridges. Even if a company or an individual user decides not to purchase remanufactured products, some send their empty cartridges to companies that do the remanufacturing. Refilling ink cartridges significantly lowers printing costs.</p>
<p class="indent">If you refill ink cartridges, you should add new ink before an old cartridge runs completely dry. Also, be sure the refill ink emulates the manufacturerâs ink. Some ink refill companies use inferior ink that, over time, has a corrosive effect on the cartridge housing. A leaky cartridge or one that bursts, causing ink to get into the printer, is trouble. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig31">Figure 9.31</a> shows an inkjet refill kit.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 9.31.</span> Inkjet refill kit</p>
<p class="indent">Some ink refill companies have an exchange system. The old ink cartridges are placed into a sealed plastic bag and returned to the company, where they are remanufactured. In return, the company ships a remanufactured cartridge filled with ink. If the empty ink cartridge sent to the company does not meet the companyâs standards criteria, the cartridge is thrown away.</p>

<p class="notepara">Toner powder is harmful if inhaled. Wear a mask when refilling. Also, wear gloves when replacing or refilling a toner cartridge to prevent toner from entering your skin pores.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">When it comes to laser cartridge remanufacturing, the most important components are the drum and the wiper blade that cleans the drum. Many laser cartridge remanufacturers use the same parts over and over again. A quality refill company will disassemble the cartridge and inspect each part. When the drum and wiper blade are worn, they are replaced with new parts. Some states have disposal requirements for inkjet and laser printer cartridges.</p>
<p class="indent">Re-inking an impact printer ribbon is not a good idea. It can cause a mess, and the ink is sometimes an inferior quality that causes deterioration of the printhead over time. Because impact printer ribbons are so inexpensive, you should just replace them.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec28"><span class="pd_blue">Printer Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A printer is one of the easiest devices to install. Refer to the printer documentation for exact installation and configuration specifics (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig32">Figure 9.32</a>). The following steps explain how to install a printer that attaches to a USB port:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Take the printer out of its box and remove the shipping materials. The number-one reason new printers do not work properly is failure to properly remove all the shipping safeguards.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Connect the power cord from the printer to the wall outlet, surge protector, or UPS outlet. Note that most UPS units are not rated high enough for a laser printer to be connected to them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Load paper and the ribbon/ink/cartridge into the printer, according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Turn on the printer and verify that the power light is on.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Install the print driver by following the manufacturerâs instructions for the particular operating system being used.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Attach the USB cable to the printer and to the computer. Note that this cable might not be provided with the printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Configure options and default settings.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> Perform a test print to verify communication between the computer and printer. Most inkjet printers have a calibration process that must be performed before normal printing. This calibration procedure is also performed when an ink cartridge is replaced.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>9.</strong> Train the user on printer operation and leave all printer documentation with the customer.</p>

<p class="notepara">The keys to a successful printer installation are to read the printer documentation, use a good cable, load the latest printer drivers (from the manufacturer), and test its operation. Many hours of frustration for the computer user and the technician can be avoided by doing the research before the installation rather than after a problem occurs.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec29"><span class="pd_blue">Upgrading Printers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Printers can be upgraded in many ways, and the options available are vendor and printer dependent. The most common upgrades include memory and tray/paper feed options. The most commonly upgraded printers are inkjet and laser printers.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common upgrade for laser printers is memory. Many laser printer manufacturers use DIMMs and SO-DIMMs now, but some printers have proprietary memory modules. The amount of memory storage available for printers (especially those shared by multiple users) is very important because printing errors can occur with too little memory. It is also important to have some means of storage so that the documents can be sent and stored away from the computer that requested the print job. This frees up the computerâs memory and hard drive space to do other tasks.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Printer memory upgrades</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Many memory technologies are available for printers, but the common ones are RAM modules, flash memory, and proprietary memory modules. These technologies are installed in the same manner as on a computer. Hard drives can also be attached to some printers for additional storage.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Paper storage trays and feeders are another common upgrade. Laser printers frequently come with various paper storage tray options. When multiple people share a printer, a small-capacity paper tray can be a nuisance. Inkjet printers often have different paper feed options related to photograph printing. Paper designed for printing photographs is available in various sizes. Special paper feed options can be purchased that are mounted onto a printer for rolls or different sizes of paper. With the increased popularity of digital photography, these printer options are quite popular.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec30"><span class="pd_blue">Printer Preventive Maintenance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Impact printers usually require cleaning more often than any other type of printer because they are frequently used for continuously fed paper or multiform paper and are often installed in industrial environments. Paper chafe, dust, and dirt cause an insulating layer of heat to form on the printer components, which causes them to fail faster. It is important to vacuum impact printers more often than other printers.</p>
<p class="indent">Inkjet printers require little preventive maintenance. Keep the interior and exterior clean of dust and particles. Use a soft brush or nonmetallic vacuum nozzle to remove dust. Do not use any type of lubricants on the print cartridge bar. Use the printerâs software or maintenance procedure for aligning the print cartridge each time it is replaced. Some printers have a âcleanâ maintenance procedure that can be done through the software that ships with the printer. Some of these processes do not clean the printhead well even when using this procedure, and the printheads tend to clog during usage. Remove the printhead and clean with a lint-free cloth or with a dampened cotton swab. Allow the cartridge to dry thoroughly and reinstall.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_421"></a>Laser printers, on the other hand, do require some periodic maintenance. The list that follows can help:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Be careful about using compressed air to clean a laser printer that has loose toner in it. The compressed air could push the toner into hard-to-reach places or into parts that heat up, causing the parts to fail. Be sure to vacuum up laser printer toner before using compressed air inside a laser printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a transfer corona is used, clean it when replacing the toner cartridge. Some printers include a small cleaning brush for this purpose. Some toner cartridges include a cotton swab. The transfer corona wire is normally in the bottom of the printer, protected by monofilament wires. Be extremely careful not to break the wires or the transfer corona.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ozone is a gas produced by laser printers that use a corona wire. Some printers have an ozone filter that removes the ozone gas as well as any toner and paper dust particles. The ozone filter needs to be replaced after a specific number of usage hours. Check the printer documentation for the filter replacement schedule. If you forget to replace the ozone filter, people in the immediate vicinity may develop headaches, sore eyes, dry throat, nausea, irritability, and depression. Most home and small office laser printers do not have ozone filters. When using these printers, the surrounding area must be well ventilated.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The fuser cleaning pad (sometimes known as the fuser wand) sits above the top fusing roller and is normally replaced at the same time as the toner cartridge. However, the cleaning pad sometimes becomes dirty before it is time to replace the cartridge. In this case, remove the cleaning pad. Hold the pad over a trash can. Use the shaft of a small flat-tipped screwdriver to rub along the felt pad. Replace the cleaning pad and wipe the screwdriver with a cloth.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The fusing roller sometimes has particles cling to it. When the assembly cools, <em>gently</em> scrape the particles from the roller. A small amount of alcohol on a soft, lint-free cloth can help with stubborn spots.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the laser printer uses a laser beam to write data to the photosensitive drum, the laser beam does not directly touch the drum. Instead, at least one mirror is used to redirect the laser beam onto the drumâs surface. The mirror(s) need to be cleaned periodically with a lint-free cloth.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Laser printer preventive maintenance is important</span></p>
<p class="notepara">If any toner appears inside a laser printer, do <em>not</em> use a normal vacuum cleaner to get it out. The toner particles seep through the vacuum cleaner bag and into the vacuumâs motor (where the particles melt). Also, the toner can become electrically charged and ignite a fire. Special HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) vacuum bags are available for some computer and/or laser printer vacuum cleaners.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Thermal printer preventive maintenance involves cleaning the heating element and removing debris from the printer. Isopropyl alcohol or premoistened thermal cleaning swabs can be used to clean the thermal printhead and rollers. Compressed air can be used, too. Allow the thermal printer and laser printer to cool before performing preventive maintenance.</p>
<p class="indent">For some printers, preventive maintenance kits are available for purchase. Quality printer replacement parts and preventive maintenance kits are important to a technician. If a printer must be sent out for repair, warranty work, or for some other reason, make sure to remove the toner cartridge, platen knobs, and power cords before packing the printer in a box. Check with the receiving company to see if you should send the toner cartridge separately.</p>

<p class="notepara">After performing preventive maintenance on a printer, the pages may appear smudged or slightly dirty. Run a few print jobs through the printer to allow the dust to settle (so to speak). Never perform any maintenance on any computer part or peripheral without testing the results.</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec31"><span class="pd_blue">Printers in the Windows Environment</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The operating system plays a big part in controlling a printer. When working in a Windows environment, there are three essential areas for a technician to know (besides knowing how to print): (1) configuration utilities, (2) managing the print driver, and (3) printer settings. Sometimes these areas overlap.</p>
<p class="indent">To print in Windows, use one of the following methods:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Open the file in the appropriate application. Click the <em>File</em> menu item and click the <em>Print</em> option.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Drag the file to print to the printerâs icon in the <em>Printers</em> folder.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Create a shortcut icon on the desktop for a specific printer and drag the file to this icon.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Right-click the filename and select the <em>Print</em> option.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ From within the application, press the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/ctrl_p.jpg" alt="Image" width="65" height="20"></span> keys to bring up the <em>Print</em> window.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ From within an application, click the printer icon located under the menu bar.</p>
<p class="indent">If multiple print jobs are in the printer queue, you can reorder them by right-clicking on a document and selecting <em>Properties</em>. On the <em>General</em> tab, change the priority. A lower number, such as 1, indicates a lower priority than a higher number such as 3.</p>

<p class="notepara">When a print job occurs, Windows normally shows an icon of a printer in the notification area (the right side of the task bar). When the print job is still accessible, you can double-click the printer icon, click the document, and pause or cancel the print job by using the <em>Documen</em>ts menu option.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">You can use the <em>Printers and Faxes</em> (XP)/<em>Printers</em> (Vista)/<em>Devices and Printers</em> (7) Control Panel to add a printer, remove a printer, temporarily halt a print job (pause the printer), and define or change printer settings, such as resolution, paper type, and paper orientation. The Windows Add Printer wizard steps you through the installation process. This utility starts automatically when Windows detects a newly connected printer. Once the wizard starts, you must select whether the printer is a local printer (used by only one computer) or a network printer. If the local printer option is selected, you will have to install a print driver. From the <em>Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer</em> link, you can add a networked printer. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a> for more information on configuring network devices.

If you upgrade the operating system or move the printer to a different computer, a different printer driver is required. The print driver enables the printerâs specific features and allows an application to communicate with the printer via the operating system. Windows applications use one print driver per printer. If you have two printers attached, two print drivers will have to be installed.</p>

<p class="indent">Printers accept as much data as possible from a computer, process that data, output it, communicate to the computer the need for more data, accept more data, and repeat the process. With Windows, a print spooler is used. A <strong><a id="ch09term40" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0762" class="pd_blue">print spooler</a></strong>, or print manager, is a software program that intercepts an applicationâs request to print. Instead of going directly to the printer, the data goes on the hard drive. The print spooler service built into the Windows operating system controls the data that is going from the hard drive to the printer. A print spooler allows multiple print jobs to be queued on the hard drive so that other work can be performed while the printer prints. The data is sent from the hard drive when the printer is ready to accept more data. Some printers come with their own print manager that replaces the Windows one.</p>
<p class="indent">If you right-click a printer and select <em>Properties</em> (or sometimes the window is under <em>Printer properties</em>), you can control the print spooler from the <em>Advanced</em> tab, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig34">Figure 9.34</a>.</p>

<p class="notepara">If a printer self-test works, try printing from Notepad. Restart the computer and click the <em>Start</em> button. Click <em>Programs</em> or <em>All Programs</em> and then click <em>Accessories</em>. Click the <em>Notepad</em> option. Type a few characters and then <em>Print</em>. If the file prints, your problem may be a print problem that affects only one application, or the printer does not have enough memory for complex output, such as high-end graphics.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Free hard drive space is important for print spooling. Insufficient free space can cause print jobs to have problems. Even if there appears to be enough hard drive space to spool a printing job, the printer may still need more RAM installed to print a large or complex document.</p>
<p class="indent">A print spooler and/or associated services, such as RPC and HTTP, can cause problems and can be stopped or paused. Locate the specific PrintSpooler, RPC, or HTTP service used by the printer (open services by typing <code>services.msc</code>). Right-click on the service and select <em>Properties</em>. From the window that appears, you can start, stop, pause, or resume a service, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09fig36">Figure 9.36</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">If the printer works, then the printer, port, and printer cable are all operational, and the problem is in the operating system. To see if the printer driver is the problem, use the <em>Add Printer Wizard</em> to install the Generic/Text Only printer driver. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09lev2sec1">Lab 9.1</a> at the end of this chapter for more information.</p>
<p class="indent">If you reload a printer driver, the old printer driver must be removed first. Some manufacturers have specific instructions for removing their drivers. Always follow their directions. Most of them say to do something similar to the following: Right-click the specific printer icon and click the <em>Delete</em> option. Click the <em>Yes</em> button when prompted if all the associated printer files are to be deleted. To re-install the printer, use the Add Printer wizard. Refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch09.html#ch09lev2sec1">Lab 9.1</a> at the end of this chapter, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">The print queue sometimes causes problems. A single document will be in the queue and not print for some reason. Depending on what rights the user has, sometimes a technician must clear the print queue. The following methods can be used:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Open the <em>Printers and Faxes</em> (XP)/<em>Printers</em> (Vista)/<em>Devices and Printers</em> (7) Control Panel. Locate the printer icon, right-click, and select <em>Open</em>. Right-click the first document (the one that is causing the problem) and select <em>Cancel</em>. To cancel all print jobs, you can select <em>Cancel all documents</em> from the <em>Printer</em> menu option.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the print job has already gone to the printer and is no longer stored on the hard drive, you may not be able to use the first method. In this case, use the <em>Printer</em> menu or <em>Cancel</em> button to cancel the print job.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Turn the printer off and back on again.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that if you get an access denied message, it means you must be logged on as an administrator to control the print queue.</p>

<p class="noindent">The printing hardware subsystem consists of the printer, cable, and communications port. If something is wrong with the hardware, the problem is normally in one of these three areas. Always check the connections and the power between the areas. The printer has the highest failure rate of the three because it is a mechanical device with motors, plastic gears, and moving parts. If an error code or message appears on the front panel, refer to the manual or online documentation. Printers normally have a self-test routine. Refer to the printerâs documentation to determine how to run the test. If a printerâs self-test operates properly, the printer is operational. In this case, a remaining print problem has to do with the port, cable, or software.</p>

<p class="notepara">If a printer is having trouble feeding paper, you should look to see how far the paper went along the paper path before it jammed or could not go any farther. Many paper-feeding problems are due to poor paper quality or the inefficiency of the rubber rollers that move the paper along the paper path. Rubber rollers are normally found in the paper transport system on all printer types, and over time, the rollers become slick from use and do not work properly.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If a printer gives a âpaper outâ message, but paper is installed in the printer, then check the paper sensor. Sometimes this sensor is an optical sensor, and sometimes it is a plastic piece that flips out. Take the paper out and reinsert it. Ensure that there is no blockage and that the sensor is not sticking (not flipping out properly). Dust and debris can cause both blockage and sensor sticking.</p>
<p class="indent">Some printers have upgradable firmware. Just as a computerâs flash BIOS can be upgraded, printers may need a firmware upgrade to correct specific problems. Printer firmware updates can normally be obtained from the printer manufacturerâs website.</p>
<p class="indent">Another problem could be that the printer is not configured for the correct port. Check that the printer is configured for the proper port. Refer to the printerâs documentation for specifics on how to configure the printer for a specific port.</p>
<p class="indent">Connect a working printer to the port, install the proper print driver and verify the port works. If the printer uses the USB port, consult the following list of troubleshooting options:</p>

<p class="notepara">Special cleaners such as Rubber Rejuvenator are available for rubber printer rollers that have a hard time picking up paper and sending it through the printer. Some printers have a special cleaning page for cleaning the rollers. Refer to the printerâs manual for exact procedures. If a cleaner is unavailable, scrub the rollers with a wire brush or sandpaper to roughen them up a bit, which will enable them to pick up the paper better. If you do not have a wire brush or sandpaper, use the sharp edge of a paper clip to roughen up the rubber part of the roller so it can grip the paper. Vacuum up all debris before using the printer.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer stops responding and the USB device is suspect, power the computer off and then back on again.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The BIOS settings may have to be enabled for USB devices. Different BIOS manufacturers list the USB settings differently. The USB settings may be located under the heading <em>Enabling onboard USB</em> or within the PCI section. If you install a USB host adapter and the motherboard also supports USB ports, you may have to disable the motherboard ports through BIOS.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use Device Manager to check whether USB is listed. Look at the <em>Universal Serial Bus controllers</em> section. If USB is not listed, check the BIOS settings or update BIOS. If the USB device is listed, ensure that there are no resource conflicts.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If there is a USB hub connected to the USB port, disconnect the hub and connect the USB printer directly to the USB port to see if the problem is the hub.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ With the computerâs power on, disconnect the USB printer and reconnect it. Go into Device Manager and ensure that there is only one listing for the USB printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_428"></a>â¢ Some USB devices have device drivers. Check the Internet for updated drivers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disconnect the USB printer while the computer is powered on. Power down the computer. Then power on the computer. Insert the USB printer cable into the USB port. The system should automatically detect and install the printer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Verify that the USB device works by plugging it into another USB port or another computerâs USB port.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check that the proper USB cable is being used. Remember that cables are not normally faulty, but they can be overtightened and undertightened. If you see garbled characters, check the cable and then the print driver.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: The paper could be the culprit</span></p>
<p class="notepara">If a printer has trouble feeding paper, ensure that youâre using the correct type of paper. One vendor says that 80 percent of all paper jams are due to inferior paper quality, poor paper condition such as damage due to humidity, or an operator-related problem such as the wrong paper size selected in the software program.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">A USB cable can be rated as SuperSpeed, Hi-Speed, or Low-Speed. The SuperSpeed and Hi-Speed cables have more shielding and can support higher speeds. If a SuperSpeed or Hi-Speed USB device attaches to a Low-Speed cable, the device operates at the lower speed. Make sure you have the proper USB cable for a printer that attaches to a USB port.</p>
<p class="indent">On the software side, troubleshooting involves narrowing down the problem to the print driver. Because Windows uses one print driver for all applications, check the printing from within several software packages. Use a simple text program such as Notepad to see if simple text will print. Printers need memory to print multiple pages of complex graphics. If a printer prints a couple pages and then stops, or if it prints half a page, ejects the paper, and then prints the other half of the page and ejects the paper, the printerâs memory needs to be upgraded. If printing does not occur in all the software packages tested, the problem is most likely the software driver. See the earlier section for specific Windows printer troubleshooting tips.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec34"><span class="pd_blue">Impact Printer Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When technicians state that a printhead is not firing, this means that one or more of the printwires are not coming out of the printhead to impact the ribbon. A printhead that is not firing is evidenced by one or more white lines appearing where the printed dots should be. On a printed page, the white line appears horizontally in the middle of a line. The most likely problem is the printhead. However, be aware that the problem could be a bad driver transistor on the main circuit board or a loose cable that attaches to the printhead. But because the printhead is a mechanical part, it is the most suspect.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Light printing can be caused by several things</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Adjust the printhead gap to place the printhead closer to the ribbon or replace the ribbon. Also, the platen could be misaligned with the bottom paper-feed rollers.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If the print is light and then dark, the printer ribbon may not be advancing properly. One of the shafts that insert into each end of the ribbon may not be turning, or the set of gears under the shaft may not mesh properly. Also, there is a motor that handles ribbon movement, and this motor may need replacement. A faulty ribbon can also cause the carriage to seize up. Remove the ribbon and power up the printer. If the carriage moves when the ribbon is removed, but it will not move when the ribbon is installed, replace the ribbon. Some printers have belts that move the printhead across the page. A worn, loose, or slipping belt can cause erratic printing.</p>
<p class="indent">If the printer prints continuously on the same line, be sure the setting for tractor-fed paper or friction-fed paper is correct. Or, the motor that controls paper movement may need replacement. If the printer moves the paper up a small bit after printing, the model may have the Auto Tear Off feature enabled. The Auto Tear Off feature is used with perforated forms needed in many businesses. See the printerâs documentation to disable this feature.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec35"><a id="page_429"></a><span class="pd_blue">Inkjet Printer Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Inkjet printers frequently have a built-in printhead cleaning routine. Access the routine through the printerâs buttons or through software. Most manufacturers recommend cleaning the inkjet cartridge only when there is a problem such as lines or dots missing from the printed output. Otherwise, cleaning the inkjet cartridge with this method wastes ink and shortens the print cartridgeâs life span.</p>
<p class="indent">Usually, inkjet manufacturers include an alignment program to align the dots more precisely. Use the alignment program when vertical lines or characters do not align properly. If the colors do not appear correctly, run the printer manufacturer-provided color calibration routine. Refer to the printerâs documentation for troubleshooting programs, such as the printhead cleaning, calibration, and alignment routines.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec36"><span class="pd_blue">Laser Printer Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Laser printers have more mechanical and electronic circuitry than the other printer types, which means there are more things that can go wrong. The following list contains some common symptoms and possible solutions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If black streaks appear on the paper or the print is not sharp, check the fuser cleaning pad for toner particles and use a small screwdriver to scrape off the excess particles before re-installing.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If output appears darker in some spots than others, remove the toner cartridge. Gently rock the toner cartridge back and forth to redistribute the toner. If this does not fix the problem, turn down the toner density by using the <em>Printers</em> Control Panel or software provided by the printer manufacturer. Also, the paper could be too smooth.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If printing appears light, adjust the darkness setting on the printer or through the printerâs operating system settings. The toner cartridge could be low. Damp paper could also cause this symptom. Use fresh paper of the proper weight and finish. If the print appears consistently dark, adjust the darkness setting.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a horizontal line appears periodically throughout the printout, the problem is one of the rollers. Check all the rollers to see if one is dirty or gouged and needs to be replaced. The rollers in a laser printer are not all the same size; the distance between the lines is the circumference of the roller. This allows you to easily tell which rollers are definitely not the problem and which ones are likely candidates.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When white vertical line(s) appear, the corona wires may have paper bits or something else stuck on them. It may also mean that something is caught in the developer unit (located in the cartridge). Replace the cartridge to see if this is the problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the opposite side of the printed page has smudges or appears dirty, the fuser could be faulty, the wrong type of paper could be being used, or the toner may be leaking.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If creases appear in the paper or if you frequently get printer jams, check the paper path for labels or other debris.</p>
<p class="indent">Many laser printer problems involve the toner cartridge, which is a good thing because the cartridge is a part people normally have on hand. Various symptoms can occur because of the toner cartridge: ghost images, smearing, horizontal streaking, vertical streaking, faded printing, one vertical black line, one horizontal black line, a white streak on one side, a wavy image, and so on. One of the easiest things to do is to remove the toner cartridge, hold the cartridge in front of you with both hands, and rock the cartridge away from you and then back toward you. Re-insert the cartridge into the printer and test the printer.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, the primary corona wire or the conditioning roller inside the toner cartridge needs to be cleaned. Clean the corona wires with the provided brush or with a cotton swab. Dampen the cotton swab with alcohol, if necessary. Clean the conditioning roller with a lint-free cloth, and dampen the cloth with alcohol, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_430"></a>To prove whether a problem is in the toner cartridge or elsewhere in the printer, send any output to the printer. When the printer is through with the writing stage and before the toner fuses to the paper, open the laser printer cover and remove the paper. (Determining exactly when to open the cover may take several attempts.) If the paper is error-free, the problem is most likely in the transfer corona (or transfer roller) or fusing assembly.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 9. Other Peripherals_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: What if a printer needs more memory?</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Alternatives to adding memory are to send fewer pages of the print job at a time, reduce the printer resolution, reduce the size of the graphics, or standardize the fonts (by not using as many font types, styles, or font sizes). Also ensure that there is ample free hard drive space.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Another common problem occurs when the laser printer does not have enough memory. One symptom of this is that when printing, the printer blinks as if it is accepting data. Then the printer quits blinking, and nothing appears or the printer prints only half the page. This could also be caused by insufficient hard drive space when spooling is enabled. Some printers give an error code if there is not enough memory.</p>
<p class="indent">Experience is the best teacher when it comes to printers. If you work on a couple impact models, a couple inkjet printers, and a couple laser printer models, you will see the majority of problems. Each type of printer has very few circuit boards to replace. Normally, the problems are in the moving parts or are software related.</p>
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec37"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâWork Ethics</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Ethics is a set of morals by which you live or work. Employers want employees who possess a high ethical standards. This means they want people who are honest, trustworthy, and dependable. IT technicians are exposed to many personal thingsâpasswords, private data, and visited Internet sites, just to name a few. Employers do not want to worry about their technicians taking things that belong to others, looking at data that does not relate to the computer problem at hand, and taking or giving away things from the office.</p>
<p class="indent">The best ruling factor in ethics is to always be professional. For example, if you are in a situation where someone asks you to give them another personâs password, ask yourself whether divulging the information is professional. When opening a customerâs documents and reading them, ask yourself whether you are being professional. If the answer is no, stop reading. If you are in a customerâs office and accidentally see the personâs password taped to a CD case, let him know that you have seen it, suggest that he not write down his passwords in a conspicuous place, and recommend that he change his passwords right away. One of the biggest assets an IT professional can have is his or her reputation. Being ethical at work goes a long way in establishing a good reputation.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, every IT person can probably remember at least one instance when he or she was asked to do something unethicalâcharge for more time than was actually spent on a job, provide access to a room or an area where access is normally restricted, or grant privileges that others at the same level do not have. When put in such a situation, there are a few options: (1) Be polite and refuse, (2) adamantly refuse, or (3) report the person to a supervisor. Recommending what to do is difficult, but for most offenses, being polite and refusing is the best course of action and is the most professional. If a request is against corporate policy or could hurt others in the company, you need to report this to a company manager or security. Your own boss may be the best person to inform.</p>
