<p class="noindent">The term <em>multimedia</em> has different meanings for people because there are many types of multimedia devices. This chapter focuses on the most popular areasâoptical drive technologies, sound cards, cameras, and speakers. These devices collectively allow you to create and output sound, music, video, movies.

Optical discs are great to use when creating or playing music CDs or movie DVDs, or for backing up data. CDs are the oldest technology, but this technology is still in use today in combination with DVD and <strong><a id="ch08term02" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0077" class="pd_blue">BD</a></strong> (Blu-ray disk)technologies.

<p class="indent">A CD has pits or indentations along the track. Flats, sometimes called lands, separate the pits. Reading information from a CD involves using a laser diode or similar device. The laser beam shines through the protective coating to an aluminum alloy layer, where data is stored. The laser beam reflects back through the optics to a photo diode detector that converts the reflected beam of light into 1s and 0s. The variation of light intensity reflected from the pits and lands is detected as a series of on/off signals that are then converted into binary code. CD and DVD drives use red laser technology, whereas Blu-ray drives use blue-violet laser technology. The blue-violet laser technology has a shorter wavelength, which means that smaller data pit sizes can be used to create higher disc capacities. This translates to more cost, too. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig02">Figure 8.2</a> shows an inside view of a CD drive. The newer technologies operate in a similar fashion.</p>

<h3 id="ch08lev1sec3"><span class="pd_blue">Optical Drive Features</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Optical drives that have an âRâ designation can only read from a disk. Drives that have an âRWâ or âREâ designation can perform both reads and writes. Drives with a âDLâ designation use dual-layer technology where two physical layers are available on the same side of the disc. The laser shines through the first layer to get to the second layer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab01">Table 8.1</a> lists common media used.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch08tab01"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 8.1.</span> Optical writeable media</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/08tab01.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="369"></div>
<p class="indent">Optical drives come in a variety of types, classified by the x factor: 1x (single-speed), 2x (double-speed), 32x, 48x, 52x, and higher. Optical drives do not operate at just a single speed, though; the speed varies depending on the type of media being read and whether writing is being done. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab02">Table 8.2</a> shows the generic transfer rates for the different x factors and types of optical drives.</p>

<p class="notepara">ODDs are frequently shown with three consecutive factor numbers, such as 52x32x52. The first number is the write speed, the second number the read/write speed, and the third number is the maximum read speed used when reading a disc.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">A lot of factors can influence how fast a drive transfers data, including how much RAM the computer has, what other applications are running, how much free hard drive space (virtual memory) there is, and the interface used to connect the optical drive; even how much RAM is on the video card can influence an ODD that has video content. Data is stored as one continuous spiral of data on optical discs. This concept is shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig03">Figure 8.3</a>. Data is, of course, in 1s and 0s, and spaced a lot closer, but the idea of one continuous spiral is important for the write-once technologies. Pits on a DVD are half the size of a CD, and the tracks are closer together so more data can be stored.</p>

<p class="notepara">One problem with ODDs occurs when data is written to the disc. If the drive does not receive data in a steady stream, a buffer underrun error occurs, and the disc is ruined if it is an -R or +R disc. To avoid this problem, avoid performing other tasks when burning data to disc.</p>

<p class="notepara">Some optical drives cannot read Blu-ray discs because CD/DVD drives use a red laser, and Blu-ray drives use a blue-violet laser. Drives that have both lasers are available.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The steps for copying files to a disc using Windows Explorer in Windows 7 follow:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Insert an optical disc. From the window that appears, select <em>Burn files to disc using Windows Explorer</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Name the optical disc and select the format type. Click <em>OK</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Open Windows Explorer and select any file(s) you want to copy. Drag them to the optical disc drive in the left panel. Continue for any files that may be in other folders.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> After selecting files, click the optical drive letter in the left panel. All files should list in the right panel.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Right-click the optical drive letter and select <em>Close session</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to reduce transfer time when writing data to the drive is by having buffer memory on the drive. When requesting data, the drive looks ahead on the disc for more data than requested and places the data in the buffer memory. <strong><a id="ch08term04" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0103" class="pd_blue">Buffer memory</a></strong> holds the extra data in the drive and then constantly sends data to the processor instead of the processor waiting for the driveâs slow access time. Buffer memory is not enough. Having little hard drive space or RAM can still slow down or abort the recording process.</p>
<p class="indent">One feature that you might use to compare if two drives have the same x factor is the random access time. The <strong><a id="ch08term17" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0790" class="pd_blue">random access time</a></strong> is the amount of time the drive requires to find the appropriate place on the disc and retrieve information. Another important comparison point is MTBF (mean time between failures) which is the average number of hours before a device is likely to fail. A closely related term that you might see instead of MTBF is <strong><a id="ch08term13" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0565" class="pd_blue">MCBF</a></strong> (mean cycles between failure) which is found by dividing the MTBF by the duration time of a cycle (operations per hour). The MCBF is actually a more accurate figure because not all drives are used the same amount of time per hour. Keep in mind that for any of these, the lower the number, the better the performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Both DVD and BD drives have <strong><a id="ch08term18" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0809" class="pd_blue">region codes</a></strong>. The world is divided into six regions for the DVD drive and three regions for a BD drive. The drive must be set for the correct region code or else the DVDs made for that area do not work. When a disc is inserted, the decoder checks what region it is configured for (or in the case of software decoding, what region the drive is configured for) and then checks for the region code. If the two match, then the movie plays. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab03">Table 8.3</a> shows the region codes for DVD and Blu-ray drives.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch08tab03"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 8.3.</span> DVD/Blu-ray region codes</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/08tab03.jpg" alt="Image" width="931" height="403"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_338"></a>A nice feature to have in a drive is the ability to use the computer to label the disc such as Hewlett-Packardâs LightScribe. The drive and disc must support this technology. Do not use the labels you can attach to the top of the disc. These can come off or not be put on properly and cause vibration and read issues. Write on the non-data side of the disc with a permanent marker as a last resort. Many drive features or capabilities can be determined by looking at the symbols on the front of the drive, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig04">Figure 8.4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ch08lev1sec4"><span class="pd_blue">Optical Drive Interfaces and Connections</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An optical drive can be internally mounted and attached to a PATA or SATA interface, or the drive can be externally attached to a USB, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), eSATA, or eSATAp (combo SATA/USB) port. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig05">Figure 8.5</a> shows an external combo drive that can read CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.5.</span> External optical drive</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_339"></a>In both desktop and portable computers, the SATA interface is the most common for internal devices and USB for external devices. Laptops and ultrabooks tend to have slot-loaded (like a car optical disc player) instead of the tray-loaded desktop models. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig06">Figure 8.6</a> shows a laptop with a slot-loaded drive.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.6.</span> Laptop slot-loaded optical drive</p>
<p class="indent">The following will help you decide what optical drive interface to recommend:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the drive going to be internal or external? If it will be internal, open the case to see if a drive bay is available. Check for a PATA or SATA interface on the motherboard. If PATA is being used, remember that in desktop models, two devices can connect to a single motherboard connector; however, SATA requires one port for each device. Remember that internal devices tend to be cheaper than external.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the drive will be internal, check that a power connection is available. A Y connector or Molex to SATA power converter may have to be purchased.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the drive will be external, check what eSATA, eSATAp, USB, or IEEE 1394 ports are available. Some USB hard drives take two ports. Ensure the drive comes with cabling or purchase separately.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check with the customer about features they may like to have, such as buffer memory and writing labels.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the customer wants to upgrade the drive, find out why. Many times, slow access is due to other components in the computer, not the drive.</p>
<h3 id="ch08lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">Optical Drive Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One thing to be concerned about with an optical drive is whether the drive is to be installed horizontally or vertically. Not all drives can be installed vertically, but most drives today can go either way.</p>
<p class="indent">The steps for installing an internal optical drive are almost identical to the steps for installing a hard drive:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Download the latest drivers before installation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Install any necessary mounting brackets.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that a proper port/interface is available. Ensure that a power connector is available. Set the appropriate configuration jumpers if necessary. Refer to the drive documentation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Turn off the power. Remove power cords. Remove the laptop battery.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_340"></a><strong>5.</strong> Install the drive. The laptop keyboard may have to be removed to access the drive. Always refer to laptop instructions for replacing drives to ensure the warranty is not voided.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Attach the power and data cables.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Enter BIOS to check drive status. Ensure that the port is enabled. Ensure that the drive is recognized. Note that you may need to reboot the machine once to see this. If the drive is not recognized in BIOS (at least that there is a drive attached), recheck settings and cabling.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> If necessary, install drivers and/or software as part of the installation process. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig07">Figure 8.7</a>. Get the drive functional by using the driver that came with the drive, if possible. Then upgrade the driver once the drive is recognized by the system.</p>

<p class="notepara">When connecting an optical drive to a PATA connector that already has a drive attached to one of the PATA cable connectors, you have to know the jumper settings on the already installed drive to correctly install the optical drive. The installed drive settings may have to be adjusted when a second device is added to the cable. The optical drive should be the slave device.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">For an external drive, download the latest drivers, ensure that you have the correct port, attach external power to the device as necessary before attaching to the port, attach the cable to the device, and attach the other end of the cable to the computer. Again, you may need a driver upgrade and/or to install some software as part of this process. Remember to check Device Manager to ensure that the device is recognized by the operating system.</p>

<p class="notepara">Verify that the computer has the hardware and software requirements for DVD playback. Update the optical drive drivers.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The following is a list of problems, along with possible solutions and recommendations:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive tray cannot be opened, make sure there is power attached. Use Windows Explorer to locate the drive, right-click the drive, and select <em>Eject</em>. Some drives have an emergency eject button or a hole you can insert a paperclip into to eject the disc. Refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig01">Figure 8.1</a> to see an example of the eject hole.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive is not recognized by the operating system, check cables, the power cord, and the configuration (master/slave, cable select, SATA speed, port enabled in BIOS).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive busy indicator flashes more slowly than normal, the disc or laser lens may be dirty. Refer to the manufacturerâs recommendations for cleaning. See the next section, on preventive maintenance, for details on how to clean a disc.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the drive cannot read a disc, ensure that the drive supports the disc being used. Ensure the disc label is facing up. Ensure that the disc is clean and without scratches. Try the disc in another machine or try a different disc to see if the problem is with the drive or the disc.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive is not recognizes as a recordable device (<em>Properties</em> and the Recording tab is missing), an updated driver or registry edit is probably needed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a DVD sound track works but video is missing or distorted, check the cabling. Verify the video drivers. Try changing the display resolution and the number of colors.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a message appears about an illegal DVD or BD region error or region code error, change the region if possible. Otherwise, you canât use the disc without a different drive that matches.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive reads only CDs and not DVDs or Blu-ray discs, update the driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_342"></a>â¢ Some optical drive problems are resolved by using DirectX. <strong><a id="ch08term07" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0242" class="pd_blue">DirectX</a></strong> allows people who write software to not have to write code to access specific hardware directly. DirectX translates generic hardware commands into special commands for the hardware, which speeds up development time for hardware manufacturers and software developers. DirectX may need to be re-installed or upgraded. Access the DirectX Diagnostic Tool in Windows by entering <span class="EmpStrong"><a id="ch08term09" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0306" class="pd_blue">dxdiag</a></span> in the Start/Run or Search dialog box.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check to see if there is a more recent driver for the drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive keeps opening the tray, check for a stuck eject button. Check for a virus. Remove the data cable (but leave the power cable attached) to see if it is the drive or a signal being sent to the drive to open.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you can hear sound from a DVD, but not a CD, get an updated optical drive driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you continue to have errors when writing to a disc, clean the laser lens or record at a lower speed. Avoid multitasking when writing.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you get a message stating that the DVD decoder is not installed, download a decoder from the DVD drive manufacturer or the computer manufacturer if the drive came with the computer. A <strong><a id="ch08term06" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0215" class="pd_blue">decoder</a></strong> makes it possible for the disc images to be played/viewed through software on your computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Not to worry if you get a message from an application that requires a disc in a specific drive letter, but because of adding drives, the optical disk drive letter has changed. You can change the drive letter using the Windows Disk Management tool. Right-click the drive in the left panel and select <em>Change Drive Letter and Paths</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Blu-ray requirements are much more stringentâensure all your video drivers, DVD drivers, the display, and video cable are all compliant for playing Blu-ray discs.</p>
<h3 id="ch08lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Preventive Maintenance for ODDs and Discs</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">CDs and DVDs have a protective coating over the aluminum alloyâbased data layer that helps protect the disc. Blu-ray has a requirement that the BD media be scratch resistant. They are less likely to need preventive maintenance. However, fingerprints, dust, and dirt can still negatively affect CD and DVD performance.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Handle discs with care</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Always handle a disc by the edges and keep the disc in a sleeve or case to aid in good performance. Never touch a discâs surface, and store discs in a cool location.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">When reading information, the optical drive laser beam ignores the protective coating and shines through to the data layer. Even if the disc has dirt on the protective coating, the laser beam can still operate because the beam is directed at the data layer rather than the disc surface. However, if dust or dirt completely blocks the laser beam, the laser beam could be reflected or distorted, thus causing distortion or data corruption. Special cleaning discs, cloths, and kits are available for cleaning optical discs. A soft lint-free cloth and spit or glass cleaner works too. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig08">Figure 8.8</a> shows proper handling during the cleaning process.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.8.</span> Disc cleaning</p>
<p class="indent">Mild abrasives or special disc repair kits can be used to repair scratched discs. Examples of mild abrasives include plastic, furniture, or brass polish. When applying the abrasive, do not rub in circles. Instead, use the same technique as cleaning: start from the innermost portion and rub outward. The abrasive can remove the scratch if it is not too deep. A wax such as furniture or car wax can be used to fill the scratch if it is not removed by the abrasive.</p>
<p class="indent">A special component of the optical drive, the <strong><a id="ch08term12" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0529" class="pd_blue">laser lens</a></strong> (also known as the objective lens) is responsible for reading information from the disc. If the laser lens gets dust, dirt, or moisture on it, the drive may report data or read errors. Some drives have the lens encased in an airtight enclosure and others have a self-cleaning laser lens. If the drive does not have this feature, look for a laser lens cleaning kit. Also, the laser lens can be cleaned with an air blower like ones used on a camera lens. Cleaning the laser lens should be part of a preventive maintenance routine. Some drive manufacturers include a special plate to keep dust away from the internal components. In any case, keep the disc compartment closed to prevent dust and dirt from accumulating on the laser lens and other drive parts.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_344"></a>Video and sound technologies are very important in todayâs IT world. No multimedia chapter would be complete without mentioning sound and digital cameras. Display technologies are in the next chapter. Sound is important to the end user, but sound is also important to the technician, so before going into installing and configuring sound-related devices, donât forget that sometimes when these devices donât work such as when the computer wonât boot, sound is still important to a technician. Motherboards have a small integrated speaker or one that attaches to motherboard pins that allows POST sounds to still be heard even if the more advanced sound system is not. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig09">Figure 8.9</a> shows the motherboard speaker.</p>

<h3 id="ch08lev1sec8"><span class="pd_blue">Theory of Sound Card Operation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Sound cards have a variety of options that can include an input from a microphone, an output to a speaker, a MIDI interface, and the ability to generate music. Take the example of bringing sound into the computer through a microphone connected to a sound card. Sound waves are shown as an analog waveform, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig12">Figure 8.12</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch08fig12"></a><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/08fig12.jpg" alt="Image" width="500" height="375"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.12.</span> Sound waves</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_346"></a>Computers work with digital signals (1s and 0s), so a sound card must convert an analog signal to a digital format to send the sound into a computer. Sound cards can also take the digital data from optical disc media and output the sound to the speakers. To convert an analog waveform to 1s and 0s, samples of the data are taken. The more samples taken, the truer the reproduction of the original signal.</p>
<p class="indent">The first sound cards made for the computer sampled the data using 8 bits. Eight 1s and 0s can give a total of 256 (2<sup>8</sup> = 256) different values. The analog waveform goes above and below a center value of 0. Because one of the 8 bits denotes negative or positive value, only 7 bits can represent sampled values. 2<sup>7</sup> = 128. The values can be 0 through +127 or 0 through â127. (The total value range is between â127 and +127.) <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig13">Figure 8.13</a> shows an example of sampling.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch08fig13"></a><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/08fig13.jpg" alt="Image" width="382" height="238"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.13.</span> 8-bit sampling</p>
<p class="indent">The more samples taken by a sound card, the closer the reproduction is to the original sound signal. The sound card <strong><a id="ch08term10" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0391" class="pd_blue">frequency response</a></strong> is dependent on the sample rate. This is also known as the sample rate or sample frequency. For a good reproduction of sound, the sound wave is sampled at twice the range desired. For example, a personâs hearing is in the 20Hz to 20KHz range. Twice that range is approximately 40,000 samples per second. The frequency response for a musical CD is 44,100 samples per second, a good quality sound <a id="page_347"></a>reproduction for human ears. The first sound cards for computers used eight bits to sample the sound wave and had a frequency response of approximately 22,000 samples per second (22KHz). The sound produced from the original sound cards was better than the beeps and chirps previously heard from the computer. The sound was still grainy, better than an AM radio station but not as good as an FM radio station or a musical disc.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, 16-bit sound cards arrived for computers. The number of possible levels sampled with 16 bits is 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536). When positive and negative levels are sampled, the range is â32,767 to +32,767. The frequency response with 16-bit sound cards is 44KHz, the same resolution as stereo audio CDs. 24-bit sampling results in a 96kHz sample rate that is sometimes called the audio resolution. The increase in the number of sampling levels and the frequency response allows sound cards to produce quality sound equal to audio discs. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig14">Figure 8.14</a> for an example of 16-bit sampling. Keep in mind that when more samples are taken, the sound card provides a better frequency response.</p>

<h3 id="ch08lev1sec9"><span class="pd_blue">Installing Sound Cards</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The steps involved in installing a sound card are similar to the steps involved in installing any other adapter. Refer to the manufacturerâs instructions when installing devices and adapters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Power off the computer, remove the computer case, and locate an empty expansion slot (making sure it is the appropriate type of slot).</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Attach appropriate cables, such as the audio cable, from the optical drive to the adapter.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Attach external devices, such as speakers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Power on the computer. Windows should detect that new hardware has been installed (if Windows does not, use the <em>Add Hardware</em> Control Panel in XP or the <em>Hardware and Sound</em> &gt; <em>Add a device</em> link in Vista/7).</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Load the appropriate device drivers for the sound card.</p>
<p class="indent">Once a sound card is installed, there are normally other programs and utilities from the sound card manufacturer that you can install as you would any other application.</p>

<p class="noindent">With Windows XP the <em>Sounds and Audio Devices</em> Control Panel and in Vista/7 the <em>Hardware and Sound</em> Control Panel link is used to change sound and adjust multimedia settings. All Windows operating systems allow controlling volume through a taskbar volume icon located in the lower-right portion of the screen. This icon can be used to mute or adjust sound.</p>

<p class="notepara">Look for the <em>Mute</em> checkbox or icon located in the volume control in the Notification area and ensure that the volume is not muted.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Audio drivers are vastly improved in Windows XP and higher to accommodate multiple streams of real-time audio and allow a kernel-mode process to handle audio management. This means that the operating system can control all aspects and improve audio performance. Digital audio can be redirected to any available output including USB and IEEE 1394 (FireWire).</p>
<p class="indent">Windows also includes a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which are commands that developers use to communicate with the sound card. DirectX has specific APIs that have commands relating to audio. In DirectX, Microsoft adds such things as DirectSound3D that has more 3-D audio effect commands, supports hardware acceleration, and allows simulation of audio sounds in certain environments, such as a tunnel or underwater. It allows software and game developers to create realistic audio environments such as muffling effects and audio directional effects (that is, the direction a sound comes from).</p>
<p class="indent">You can tell whether a device has integrated sound or a sound adapter installed by inspecting the <em>Sound, video and game controller</em> category in Device Manager. The left side of <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig15">Figure 8.15</a> shows a screen capture of Device Manager from a computer that has integrated sound on the motherboard. Note that integrated sound may be located in the <em>System devices</em> or <em>Other devices</em> categories.</p>

<p class="indent">Microphones are commonly used in conference calls and VoIP (voice over IP) calls. VoIP is a technology where phone calls are digitized and transmit using the data network rather than using a traditional corporate digital voice network or the PSTN (public switched telephone networkâin other words, the traditional phone network). Microphones can be attached to a headset, a separate device, integrated into the computer display, or integrated into the device such as with mobile devices. To see your microphone settings on a Windows device, use the <em>Hardware and Sound</em> Control Panel, in the Sound section locate and select <em>Manage audio devices</em>, and click the <em>Recording</em> tab. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig16">Figure 8.16</a> shows a microphone that is built into a flat panel monitor. Once you select the microphone, you can use the <em>Properties</em> button to adjust the microphone settings.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mobile devices are more limited in their sound options than are desktop computers. However, a portable device normally has an integrated microphone, a line out connector for headphones, and sound integrated into the motherboard. Sometimes the speakers must be replaced. Laptop, netbook, or ultrabook speakers tend to mount in the back corners of the device or extend along the internal sides. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig17">Figure 8.17</a> shows two different models of mobile device speakers.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.17.</span> Laptop speaker connectivity</p>
<p class="indent">Another option for laptops and desktop computers is using a USB port or adding a USB sound card. USB sound devices work with both analog and digital signals. Insert the sound card into a USB port and have instant quality sound. Keep in mind that if the sound device is powered by the USB port, this shortens battery life.</p>
<p class="indent">Wireless sound connectivity is also an option. A PC or a laptop that has wireless network connectivity can have music stored on it. A wireless receiver allows music to be played anywhere within wireless network range.</p>
<p class="indent">Laptop devices normally can control sound with buttons above the keypad or by selecting a combination of keys such as <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/fn.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="20"></span> + <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/f6.jpg" alt="Image" width="25" height="21"></span>. The icon on the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/f6.jpg" alt="Image" width="25" height="21"></span> key (or whatever key is used) is normally an icon of a sound wave getting louder or softer (<span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/louder.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="20"></span>) or an icon of an up or down arrow (<span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 8. Multimedia Devices_files/down-arrow.jpg" alt="Image" width="21" height="18"></span>).</p>
<p class="indent">For Android mobile devices, use the <em>Sound Setting</em> option to mute and modify the ringtone. Optionally, you can also select sounds to be played such as when the screen unlocks or when switching between screens. Android smartphones normally have microphones of course, but not all Android-based tablets do.</p>
<p class="indent">For Apple iOS devices, use the <em>General Settings</em> option. Then locate <em>Sounds</em>. The speaker volume and sounds heard for email, phone calls, reminders, keyboard clicks, and so on are set on this screen. Both Android and Apple iOSâbased mobile devices have volume controls on the sides. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig18">Figure 8.18</a> shows the sound settings on an Apple iPad2.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.18.</span> Apple iPad2 sound settings</p>
<p class="indent">Microphones in tablets normally do not have controls like netbooks, laptops, and PCs. Instead, the microphone is controlled through an application that supports a microphone, such as a notepad that allows you to add audio notes or record a lecture or an online conference application. Inside the application, there is normally a little icon of a microphone that you tap to be able to start recording. External microphones can be added using wireless Bluetooth connectivity or an external microphone for those tablets that have a jack. Smartphones, of course, have integrated microphones.</p>
<h3 id="ch08lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">Speakers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most people connect speakers to a sound card or integrated sound ports. The quality of sound is personal; sounds that are acceptable to one person are not always acceptable to someone else. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab05">Table 8.5</a> shows some features to look for in speakers.</p>

<p class="notepara">Listen to them without headphones, using an audio (non-software) CD, DVD, or BD.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Most computers come with internal or external speakers. Sometimes the external speakers produce poor quality sound. Also, some of the external speakers are battery-powered, which might not be desired. Speakers with an external power source are best. One speaker commonly connects to the sound card port, and the other speaker is daisy-chained to the first speaker. Some speakers have an external volume control. Be mindful of this as it is another thing to check for when sound does not occur. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig19">Figure 8.19</a> shows computer speakers that are powered with an AC adapter.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.19.</span> Front view of speakers</p>
<p class="indent">USB, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), and wireless solutions can also be used to provide connectivity for speakers. Digital audio is sent over the bus, and an external speaker converts the signal into sound. When audio is converted inside the computer, interference from internal electronic components and external sources (especially if an expansion slot does not have an adapter installed and the case has an opening) can cause audio interference. The drawback to USB is that it puts more work on the CPU. However, in todayâs multi-processor environment, this may not be an issue. The following is a list of extras to look for in speakers:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ An external volume control</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Headphone jacks</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_352"></a>â¢ Headphone and microphone pass-through connectors (so you do not have to dislodge the computer to reach the jacks)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ AC adapter</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Connectors for the speakers to connect to the sound card</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the sound card is capable of 3D sound, a four- or six-speaker system is an enhancement</p>
<p class="indent">Two speakers are normally joined by a cable that may or may not be removable. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig20">Figure 8.20</a> shows how a cable that plugs into the right speaker would have the other end connected to the left speaker.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.20.</span> Speaker connections</p>
<p class="indent">When speakers power on, they sometimes emit a popping sound. This is normal, but if the sound continues after the speakers are powered on, the speaker is probably picking up interference from the computer or another device. Try moving the speakers farther away from the computer.</p>
<h3 id="ch08lev1sec13"><span class="pd_blue">Troubleshooting Sound Problems</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The following is a list of common sound problems and solutions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a speaker is emitting unwanted sounds, make sure there are no empty adapter slots in the computer. Next, check the speaker wires for cuts, move the sound card to another expansion slot, and move the speakers farther away from the computer. Finally, move the computer away from the offending device or the offending device away from the computer. If the speakers produce a humming noise and are AC powered, move the speaker power cord to a different wall outlet. Plugging the speakers into the same circuit as the computer is best.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If sound is a problem or if any solution directs you to update your sound driver, access <em>Device Manager</em> and expand the <em>Sound, video, and game controllers</em>, <em>System devices</em>, or <em>Other devices</em> option. Locate and right-click the integrated sound or the sound card and select <em>Properties</em>. Select the <em>Driver</em> tab and use the <em>Update driver</em> button.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_353"></a>â¢ If the sound card is not working, check Device Manager to see if the sound card is listed twice. If there are two entries for the same sound card, remove both of them by clicking each entry and clicking the <em>Remove</em> button. Restart Windows, and the operating system should detect the adapter and either install a device driver or prompt for one. For best results, use the latest device driver from the sound card manufacturer or computer manufacturer in the case of integrated ports.</p>

Use the checkbox to display the icon in the Notification area.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If audio is low no matter what disc or system sound is played, the speakers may not be amplified speakers or they may not be connected to the correct sound card port. Also, do not forget to check the computer sound settings through the icon on the taskbar or the <em>Sounds and Audio Devices</em> (XP) or <em>Hardware and Sound</em> (Vista/7) Control Panel. If a yellow question mark is there, right-click the sound card, select <em>Properties</em>, and check the Device status section to see the issue. Many issues require driver updates.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If one disc does not output sound but other discs work fine, the disc may use a later version of DirectX than the one installed. Check the recommended DirectX version for the disc. Also, the disc may have a problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If building a computer, install the sound card after installing the video card, hard drive, and optical drive, but before anything else. Some sound cards are inflexible about system resource changes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For headphone issues, ensure the cable attaches to the correct line out port. Determine if you want the speakers disabled. Normally, if you plug into the headphones line out port, the speakers cut off.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For Android or iOS devices, check the volume control and whether the device is muted.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ On tablets or smartphones, check if any other applications might be using the microphone that are still running by using the Android <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Apps</em> &gt; <em>Running</em> tab. Select the application and select <em>Force stop</em>. For Apple iOS devices, push the home button twice to see running applications &gt; tap the one you want to close.</p>
<p class="indent">If sound does not come out of the optical drive after the drivers and software load, try the following troubleshooting tips:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Be sure an audio disc is inserted into the drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If sound no longer comes out of the speakers, check the speaker cables.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the proper installation of the audio cable.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ensure that the speakers or headphones connect to the drive or to the sound card or integrated sound port.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If using speakers, check the insertion of the cable jack on the back of the sound card. Verify that the speakers have batteries installed or an AC adapter connected.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If using headphones, verify that the headphones work on another device before using them to test the drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_354"></a>â¢ Get updated drivers from the sound card manufacturerâs website.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the monitorâs image quality decreases after installing a sound card with speakers, move the speakers farther away from the monitor.</p>

<p class="indent">Resolution is an important concept when scanning a document or photo. When scanning something, always think about whether the output is intended for the printer or the monitor. Setting the scannerâs resolution to the maximum amount for every scan is not a good idea. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab09">Table 8.9</a> shows some sample resolutions for scanning.</p>

<p class="indent">A scannerâs plate glass needs to be cleaned periodically. To test the cleaning, scan a full page without a document loaded onto the scanner. See if the results yield any smudges or streaks. Use these best practices:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The best cleaning method is to put optical surface cleaning fluid on an antistatic cleaning cloth and then wipe the glass.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Never spray cleaner directly on the glass.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not use rough paper towels.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A commercial glass cleaner or water can be used.</p>

<h3 id="ch08lev1sec15"><span class="pd_blue">Digital Cameras</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Video recording capabilities can be built into a computer or a mobile device, an attachment to a computer, or a standalone digital camera or camcorder used for the purpose of taking photographs or recording movies. A digital camera resolution is measured in pixels. The resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels the camera can use to display an image. Today, digital camera resolution technology has evolved into MPs (megapixels). A cameraâs photosensors determine how many pixels can be used. Common resolutions for integrated tablet cameras and smartphones is 1.2 to 5MP or more compared to 4 to 18MP found in digital cameras. (Of course, these numbers will be higher the moment this book goes to press.)</p>
<p class="indent">Some of cameras store the photographs or movies on flash media (mini-SD, microSD, xD, Compact Flash, etc.) or hard drives, usually in the JPEG file format, but some cameras can save in RAW or TIFF formats. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab10">Table 8.10</a> shows camera storage media, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08tab11">Table 8.11</a> lists common file formats.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_359"></a>A memory card reader or multi-card reader is a popular device that many people attach externally or have integrated into a computer or mobile device. A reader has multiple slots that allow different memory media to be read. This device is called many names, and common ones include 15-in-1 reader, 8-in-1 reader, or 5-in-1 reader (depending on how many different slots or types of memory modules it accepts). The reader instantly recognizes inserted memory cards, which can be copied into the computer and manipulated. The media card slots are assigned drive letters that are accessible through Windows Explorer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig24">Figure 8.24</a> shows one of these readers.</p>

Web cameras can also be found that attach to VoIP phones and activate when a phone session occurs for instant web conferencing. Some web cams have a small visor that can be flipped over the lens to prevent video when desired. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch08.html#ch08fig25">Figure 8.25</a> illustrates a web cam.

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 8.26.</span> Dell Webcam Control software</p>
<p class="indent">To operate an integrated camera on an Apple iOS or Android device, use the <em>Camera</em> option from the home page. Use the <em>Photos</em> application (iOS) or <em>Gallery</em> application (Android) to see the saved images.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of what multimedia device is integrated or connects to a computer, all devices attach and install similarly. When installing a new device for a customer, donât forget to allow the customer to test the device while you are still there. Also, remember to leave all documentation related to the installation with the customer. They paid for the device and are entitled to the documentation.</p>
<h3 id="ch08lev1sec16"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâAttitude</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A technicianâs attitude is one of his or her greatest assets. Some consider having a good attitude as simply being positive at work, but this is not the entire picture. A technician with a good attitude has the following traits:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Is proactive, not reactive.</strong> A good technician actively looks for a solution rather than waiting for someone to instruct him or her.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Seeks solutions instead of providing excuses.</strong> A positive person does not continually apologize or talk in a subservient tone. For example, a positive technician explains issues such as late deliveries in a professional, positive manner.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Accepts responsibility for actions taken.</strong> If you forget something or take a misstep, then you should apologize and explain to the customer what happened. Truth goes a long way with customers. A positive technician does not constantly shift blame to other departments or technicians. Even if the other department or technician is responsible, the person with a positive attitude handles the customer and then talks to the other department or technician about the problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Deals with priority changes professionally.</strong> In the IT field, computer and network problems arise that cause us to reprioritize tasks weekly, daily, and even hourly. These are normal occurrences and a person with a positive attitude understands this.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_361"></a>â¢ <strong>Cooperates and enjoys working with others.</strong> A positive attitude is contagious, and others like being around it.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Maintains professionalism even when working with a coworker who is unethical, unprofessional, or uncooperative.</strong> A technician with a good attitude does not let someone elseâs poor attitude be a negative influence.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ <strong>Embraces problems as challenges to learn and develop skills.</strong> Sometimes, after joining the IT field, a technician becomes complacent and does not seek new skills. The IT field requires that you constantly improve and refine your skills. See a tough problem as a challenge, not a burden. With such an attitude, problems will not frustrate you, but will serve as a catalyst for an advancement or makes you a better technician.</p>
<p class="indent">You should exhibit all these traits consistently to establish a positive mental attitude and make it part of your daily habits.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> List some tips on how to determine whether a computer has an optical drive installed, as if you were stepping through it over the phone with a customer who is not a technician. Practice with a classmate, using your instructions.</p>
<p class="enter"><a id="page_378"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> The class is divided into groups of five. Each group makes a list of three categories that relate to multimedia devices. The five groups share their lists and determine which group works on which category. In 30 minutes, each team comes up with five answers with the corresponding questions for their category. The answers are rated from 100 to 500 with 100 being the easiest question. The teams play <em>Jeopardy!</em>, with the rule that no team may choose its own category.</p>
<h4 id="ch08lev2sec12">Critical Thinking Skills</h4>
<p class="objective"><em>Objective</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To analyze and evaluate information, and apply information to new or different situations</p>
<p class="activitie"><em>Activities</em>:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> For this activity, you need an advertisement of an optical drive, including the technical specifications. Make a list of all terms related to the drive that you do not know. Using books, the Internet, or other resources, research these terms and define them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Form teams of two. Several multimedia devices are needed. The devices are numbered. Each team selects a number and installs, configures, and tests the associated device. Each team documents its installation and shares its experience (including lessons learned) with the rest of the class.</p>
