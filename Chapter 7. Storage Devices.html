<p class="noindent">Storage devices hold the data we are so fond of generating and keepingâphotos, PDFs, documents, spreadsheets, movies, and whatever else we can think to save. This data is stored on optical media, flash media, magnetic media such as hard drives, and floppy disks, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig01">Figure 7.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_251"></a>Data can also be stored âin the cloud.â This means that there are storage devices available through the Internet to store data. Some storage is provided by an Internet provider or as a service for a mobile device. Some companies, such as SugarSync, Inc., and DropBox, provide a limited amount of free storage, with the option to pay for more. Since mobile devices have limited or no storage capability, cloud storage is a viable, if not necessary, option. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig02">Figure 7.2</a> illustrates this concept, but keep in mind that âin the cloudâ is just a ton of hard drives out there somewhere.</p>

<p class="noindent">Floppy drives are seldom seen in a computer today, but a technician might see one. A floppy drive subsystem consists of three main parts: (1) the electronic circuits or the controller, (2) the 34-pin ribbon cable, and (3) the floppy drive (sometimes called the âaâ drive). The electronic circuits give the floppy drive instructions: âFloppy drive, go to this location and read some data! The internal floppy drive ribbon cable connects the floppy drive to the electronic circuits. The floppy drive is the device that allows saving data to disk media. If a floppy drive is required today, it is typically connected to the computer using a USB port.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting and installing floppy drives involves these three main areas and the media. Media refers to the disks inserted in the floppy drive. Almost any floppy drives are 3.5-inch 1.44MB.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec3"><a id="page_252"></a><span class="pd_blue">Floppy Media and Construction</span></h3>

On one side, a disk has a sliding write-protect window that allows the disk to be written to or protected from any writing or changing of data that is occurring. If you close the window, data can be written to the disk. If the window is open, the disk is write-protected and data cannot be written on the disk.</p>

<p class="indent">Pin 1 on the cable needs to attach to pin 1 on the connector. Pin 1 on a cable is easy to find because of the colored stripe that is on one side of the cable. Pin 1 on an adapter or a motherboard is not always easy to locate. Some manufacturers put a small 1 or 2 by the end where the cableâs pin 1 inserts. Other manufacturers put larger numbers at the opposite end. For example, if you see the number 33 or the number 34 on the motherboard where the floppy cable inserts, pin 1 and pin 2 are on the <em>opposite</em> end of the connector. Installation is nothing more than mounting the floppy drive to the computer case and connecting the cable between the drive and motherboard or adapter.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">Hard Drive Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hard drives are some of the most popular devices for storing data. They store more data than floppy drives and move data faster than tape drives. Todayâs hard drive capacities extend into the terabytes. Hard drives are frequently upgraded in computers, so it is important for you to understand all the technical issues. These issues include knowing the parts of the hard drive subsystem, how the operating system and the BIOS work with a hard drive, how to configure a hard drive, and how to troubleshoot it. The hard drive subsystem can have up to three parts: (1) the hard drive, (2) a cable that attaches to an adapter or the motherboard, and (3) control circuits located on an adapter or the motherboard.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Hard Drive Geometry</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Traditional mechanical hard drives are magnetic hard drives. These hard drives have multiple hard metal surfaces called platters. Each platter typically holds data on both sides and has two read/write heads, one for the top and one for the bottom. The read/write heads float on a cushion of air without touching the platter surface. Data is written by using electromagnetism. A charge is applied to the read/write head creating a magnetic field. The metal hard drive platter has magnetic particles that are affected by the read/write headâs magnetic field allowing 1s and 0s to be âplacedâ or âinducedâ onto the drive, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig05">Figure 7.5</a>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 7.5.</span> Writing to a hard drive</p>
<p class="indent">The hard drive platters spin at different rotational rates called RPMs (revolutions per minute). Common ones are 5400, 7200, 10,000, and 15,000 rpm. The faster the rpm, the faster the transfer rate and generally, an increased cost.</p>
<p class="indent">If a read/write head touches the platter, a <strong><a id="ch07term36" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0431" class="pd_blue">head crash</a></strong> occurs. This is sometimes called HDI (head-to-disk interference), and it can damage the platters or the read/write head, causing corrupt data. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig06">Figure 7.6</a> for an illustration of a hard driveâs actuator arms, heads, and platters. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig07">Figure 7.7</a> shows the inside of a hard drive. You can see the top read/write head and the platters. Keep in mind that you should not remove the cover from a hard drive because you could allow particles into the sealed drive area.</p>

<p class="indent">The hard drive surface is metallic and has concentric circles, each of which is called a track. Tracks are numbered starting with the outermost track, which is called track 0. One corresponding track on all surfaces of a hard drive is a cylinder. For example, cylinder 0 consists of all track 0s; all of the track 1s comprise cylinder 1, and so on. A track is a single circle on one platter. A cylinder is the same track on all platters. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig08">Figure 7.8</a> shows the difference between tracks and cylinders.

<p class="indent">Hard drives also come in different physical sizes (form factors). For desktop and small server models, 5.25-inch (not very popular) and 3.5âinch drives are available. The 2.5-inch form factor is designed for laptops and netbooks. A 1.8-inch form factor is available for use and can be found in SSDs, ultrabooks, and ultraportable devices such as MP3 players. Some PC Card/Express bus storage card/drives are available, but external hard drives are more popular. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig10">Figure 7.10</a> shows various hard drive sizes. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig11">Figure 7.11</a> shows a 2.5-inch hard drive installed in a netbook.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Hard Drive Interfaces Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A hard drive system must have a set of rules to operate. These rules specify the number of heads on the drive, what commands the drive responds to, the cables used with the drive, the number of devices supported, the number of data bits transferred at one time, and so on. These rules make up a standard called an interface that governs communication with the hard drive. There are two major hard drive interfaces: <strong><a id="ch07term39" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0470" class="pd_blue">IDE</a></strong> (integrated drive electronics), also known as <a id="page_258"></a>the ATA (AT Attachment) or <strong><a id="ch07term25" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0316" class="pd_blue">EIDE</a></strong> (Enhanced IDE) standard, and <strong><a id="ch07term64" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0861" class="pd_blue">SCSI</a></strong> (Small Computer System Interface). IDE is the most common in home and office computers. SCSI is commonly found in network servers.</p>
<p class="indent">Both IDE and SCSI started out as parallel architectures. This means that multiple bits are sent over multiple paths. This architecture requires precise timing as transfer rates increase. Also with both types of devices, multiple devices can attach to the same bus. With parallel IDE or <strong><a id="ch07term50" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0693" class="pd_blue">PATA</a></strong> (Parallel ATA), it was only two devices and with SCSI it was more, but the concept is the same. When multiple devices share the same bus, they have to wait their turn to access the bus and there are configuration issues with which to contend. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig13">Figure 7.13</a> shows the concept of parallel transfer.</p>

<p class="indent">Today, the trend is toward serial architectures. Both the IDE and SCSI standards have a serial architecture available. The ATA serial device is known as a <strong><a id="ch07term60" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0848" class="pd_blue">SATA</a></strong> (Serial ATA) device, and the serial SCSI serial device is known as a <strong><a id="ch07term59" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0847" class="pd_blue">SAS</a></strong> (Serial Attached SCSI) device. A serial architecture is a point-to-point bus where each device has a single connection back to the controller. Bits are sent one at a time over a single link. More devices can attach to this type of architecture because it scales easier and configuration is much easier. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig14">Figure 7.14</a> illustrates the concept of serial data transfer.</p>

<p class="noindent">IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) is not only for traditional mechanical hard drives but for other internal devices, such as tape, Zip, and optical drives. The original IDE standard was developed only for hard drives and is officially known as ATA (AT Attachment). Later, other devices were supported by the standard and the standard evolved to ATA/ATAPI (AT Attachment Packet Interface). ATAPI increased support of devices such as CD/DVD and tape drives. There are two types of ATAâPATA (Parallel ATA) and SATA (Serial ATA).</p>
<p class="indent">PATA is the older IDE/EIDE type, which uses a 40-pin cable that connects the hard drive to an adapter or the motherboard and transfers 16 bits of data at a time. Each cable normally has either two or three connectors. Many motherboards have both SATA and PATA IDE connectors. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig16">Figure 7.16</a> shows the difference between a PATA and a SATA motherboard connection.</p>

<p class="notepara">One 40-pin motherboard PATA connector can support up to two PATA devices. However, some cables only have two connectorsâone that connects to the motherboard and one that attaches to the PATA device. If a second device is added, a new cable must be purchased.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The original IDE interface supported up to two drives and is also known as the ATA-1 Standard (AT Attachment Standard). The ATA-5 standard (also known as Ultra ATA/66 or ATA/66) was important because the PATA cable changed. A 40-pin cable is used with this standard as with the other standards, but the cable is differentâit has 80 conductors. The 40 extra conductors are ground lines, which are situated between the existing 40 wires. These ground lines reduce crosstalk, improves the accuracy of data transfers, and allows faster speed. Signals from one wire can interfere with the signals on an adjacent wire; this is called crosstalk. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig18">Figure 7.18</a> shows the older 40-pin cable and the newer 80-conductor cable. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07tab01">Table 7.1</a> shows the ATA standards.</p>

These devices are commonly seen marked as SATA, SATA II, and SATA III.</p>
<p class="indent">SATA is a point-to-point interface, which means that (1) each device connects to the host through a dedicated link (unlike the traditional parallel IDE where two devices share the host link), and (2) each device has the entire interface bandwidth. SATA uses a smaller, 7-pin cable that is more like a network cable than the traditional IDE ribbon cable. SATA supports both internal and external devices. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig19">Figure 7.19</a> shows an internal SATA drive with the cable attached.

<p class="indent">An internal SATA device uses a 15-pin SATA power connector rather than a Molex that the older hard drives used. A Molex to SATA cable converter can be purchased, but the connector can only provide 5 and 12 volts, not 3.3 volts. The good news is that most SATA drives do not <a id="page_262"></a>use the 3.3V line. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig20">Figure 7.20</a> shows the older Molex power connector compared to the internal SATA power connector.</p>

<p class="indent">Internal and external SATA devices are also found in laptops and netbooks. Tablets and smartphones do not normally contain drives, but use flash memory instead. Just a short time ago, internal SATA devices tended to be smaller in capacity in mobile devices than in desktop computers, but that is no longer true. Internal SATA devices can connect to the older PCI or the newer PCIe bus. External SATA devices are connected using the same methods as a desktopâeSATA or eSATAp.

<p class="noindent"><strong><a id="ch07term73" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0936" class="pd_blue">SSDs</a></strong> (solid state drives) are storage devices that use nonvolatile flash memory technologies instead of hard drive technologies. SSDs connect to the computer through several types of interfaces: SATA, SAS, PCIe, USB, PATA, and SCSI. SSDs eliminate the number-one cause of hard drive failure: moving parts. SSDs typically use flash memory and can therefore be low heat producing, reliable, quiet, secure, long-lasting, and fast. SSDs are being installed in laptops and desktop models as internal and external units. SSDs are common in tablets and some mobile devices. They are also used in environments such as temperature extremes or where the drive might be jolted. SSDs can be used in conjunction with mechanical hard drive storage. SSDs are used in the following industries:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ MedicalâCRT/MRI image storage, monitoring equipment, portable devices</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ ITâVideo surveillance, wireless base stations, security appliances</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ IndustrialâRobotic systems, test equipment, manufacturing devices</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ AutomotiveâDiagnostics, store safety information, store travel statistics</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference between hard drives and SSDs is how data is actually written. Write amplification and wear leveling are two terms used with SSDs that technicians should understand. To write data, an SSD may have to do an erase operation, move data to another location, and then write the information to memory. Still, overall performance is increased. <strong><a id="ch07term79" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1102" class="pd_blue">Write amplification</a></strong> is the minimum amount of memory storage space affected by a write request. For example, if there is 4KB of information to be written and the SSD has a 128KB erase block, 128KB must be erased before the 4KB of information can be written. Writing takes longer than reading with SSDs.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch07term78" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1079" class="pd_blue">Wear leveling</a></strong> is a technique used to erase and write data using all of the memory blocks instead of the same memory blocks repeatedly. SSD manufacturers are using various technologies: (1) software to track usage and direct write operations, (2) a certain amount of reserved memory blocks to use when a memory block does fail, and (3) a combination of the two techniques.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_264"></a>Two types of technologies used with SSDs are SLC and MLC. <strong><a id="ch07term71" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0908" class="pd_blue">SLCs</a></strong> (single-level memory cells) store 1 bit in each memory cell and last longer than MLCs, but they are more expensive. <strong><a id="ch07term45" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0593" class="pd_blue">MLCs</a></strong> (multi-level memory cells) store more than 1 bit in each memory cell and are cheaper to manufacturer, but they have slower transfer speeds.</p>
<p class="indent">The main drawback to SSDs is cost. SSDs are expensive compared to hard drives. As with flash drives, each memory block of an SSD has a finite number of reads and writes. An SSD that writes data across the entire memory capacity will last longer. Some companies are including software with the drive that tracks or estimates end of life. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig23">Figure 7.23</a> shows the insides of an SSD.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec10"><span class="pd_blue">SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) can control many different types of devices such as scanners, tape drives, hard drives, optical drives, printers, and disk array subsystems. SCSI comes in two types: parallel SCSI (usually referred to as simply SCSI) and SAS (serial attached SCSI), which is covered in the next section. The parallel SCSI standard allows connection of multiple internal and external devices to the same adapter. All devices that connect to the same parallel SCSI controller share a common data bus called the SCSI bus (or SCSI chain). Features such as increased speed and multiple device support cost more. Parallel SCSI is more expensive than PATA drives.</p>
<p class="indent">The SCSI host adapter (usually a separate card, but it can be built into the motherboard) connects the SCSI device to the motherboard and coordinates the activities of the other devices connected. Three basic standards of SCSI are called SCSI-1, SCSI-2, and SCSI-3. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig24">Figure 7.24</a> shows a SCSI hard drive, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07tab02">Table 7.2</a> shows parallel SCSI standards.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_266"></a>The latest SCSI devices that might be found in a PC are known as SAS (Serial Attached SCSI). SAS devices connect through a serial architecture which means they attach in a point-to-point bus. SAS devices are more expensive than SATA IDE devices because they target the enterprise environment where high reliability and high <strong><a id="ch07term46" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0616" class="pd_blue">MTBF</a></strong> (mean time between failuresâthe average number of hours before a drive is likely to fail) is important. SAS drives come in two flavorsâ3 and 6Gbps. SAS devices are normally hard drives, but SAS could also be used for other devices such as tape drives. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig25">Figure 7.25</a> shows SAS drives that would insert into a network server.</p>

<p class="indent">SCSI storage devices are more frequently found in a network environment. Other types of SCSI used with networking include FC (Fibre Channel), SSA (Serial Storage Architecture), and iSCSI.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec11"><span class="pd_blue">Storage Device Configuration Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Drive configuration sometimes includes setting jumpers on the drive and sometimes on the associated adapter and ensuring proper termination. Termination is a method used to prevent signals from reflecting back up the cable. Each drive type has a normal configuration method. However, individual drive manufacturers may develop their own configuration steps. Always refer to the documentation included with the drive, adapter, or motherboard for configuration and installation information.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">PATA Physical Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">PATA IDE devices (including hard drives) are simpler to configure than parallel SCSI devices. The overall steps for installing a PATA device are as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Keep the drive in the protective antistatic container until you are ready to install.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Use proper antistatic handling procedures when installing the drive and handle the drive by the edges; avoid touching the drive electronics and connectors.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Turn off and remove the power cord when installing the drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_267"></a><strong>4.</strong> Determine how many devices will attach to the same cable and configure their jumpers accordingly.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Physically mount and secure the device in the computer and attach the proper cable.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Configure the BIOS, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> If a hard drive, prepare the drive for data as described later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Actually, these steps apply to SATA and SCSI as well except for configuring jumpers and for SATA, determining how many devices attach to the same cable because SATA is a point-to-point architecture and only one device attaches to the connector.</p>
<p class="indent">Older motherboards frequently had two PATA IDE connectors (although a few had three or four). The IDE connectors are known as the primary or primary IDE channel, secondary or secondary IDE channel, and if there are third or fourth connectors, they are known as the tertiary channel and quaternary channel respectively. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig26">Figure 7.26</a> shows a motherboard with four integrated IDE connectors.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 7.26.</span> PATA motherboard connectors</p>
<p class="indent">Each channel (connector) can have a master and a slave device. To distinguish between the devices, use the channel name followed by the words <strong><a id="ch07term43" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0560" class="pd_blue">master</a></strong> or <strong><a id="ch07term70" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0907" class="pd_blue">slave</a></strong>. The two settings are simply used to distinguish between the two devices because only one of the two devices (master or slave) can transmit data when connected to the same IDE channel (cable). For example, if two hard drives are installed on the primary channel, they are called primary master and primary slave.</p>
<p class="indent">PATA IDE devices are normally configured using jumpers. The four options commonly found are single, master, slave, and cable select. The <strong><a id="ch07term69" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0901" class="pd_blue">single</a></strong> IDE setting is used when only one device connects to the cable. The master IDE setting is used in conjunction with the slave setting and both are used when two IDE devices connect to the same cable. One device is set to the master setting while the other device uses the slave setting. The <strong><a id="ch07term08" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0115" class="pd_blue">cable select</a></strong> IDE option replaces the master/slave setting. The device automatically configures itself to either the master setting or the slave setting depending on the specific cable connector to which the device attaches. To use the cable select option, a special 80-conductor, 40-pin cable is needed. This cable has pin 28 disabled. All 80-conductor (40-pin) cables that meet the ATA specifications automatically support cable select, and the connectors, are color-coded according to the specifications. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig27">Figure 7.27</a> shows the connections for an 80-conductor cable.</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A special IDE cable select cable or the 80-conductor (40-pin) cable must be used.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The host interface (controlling circuits) must support the cable select option.</p>

<p class="notepara">Do not set to the cable select option unless the 80-conductor cable is installed. If two devices are set to the cable select option and a regular IDE cable is used, both devices are configured as master and will not work properly.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">There are two methods of configuring PATA IDE devices: (1) configure one device as master and the other device as slave or (2) configure both devices to the cable select option. By doing this, the device that connects to the black connector becomes the âmasterâ and the device that connects to the gray connector becomes the âslave.â Whichever method is used, the following are recommendations:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When two IDE devices connect to the same cable, the faster or larger capacity device should be configured as master. Hard drives are normally the fastest IDE devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When only one device (the master) connects to an older 40-conductor IDE cable, connect the device to the end connector (the one farthest from the motherboard) for best performance. Some devices show errors when there is only one IDE device and it connects to the center cable connector.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_269"></a>â¢ If there are two PATA IDE devices installed in the computer, a hard drive and an optical drive, install the hard drive on one IDE channel (primary) and the optical drive on the secondary IDE channel.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid putting a hard drive and an optical drive on the same channel. The optical device uses a more complicated command set than the hard drive and it can slow down the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you have two optical drives and you transfer data frequently between the two, it is best to put them on separate channels. However, putting one of these devices with a hard drive is not a good idea either.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For optimum performance, connect the hard drive that you boot from to the primary IDE motherboard connector and configure it as master.</p>

However, when installing a faster drive to a slower portâsuch as when installing a 3.0Gbps drive to a 1.5Gbps portâa jumper may need to be configured so the drive is compatible with the port. Always refer to the drive manufacturerâs documentation when installing a drive. Attach the power cord to the drive, if applicable, and insert the other end of the power cord into a wall outlet. Attach one end of the eSATA cable to the drive. Plug the other end of the cable into an eSATA port on the computer. Note that some systems use the original SATA 1.5Gbps (sometimes called SATA 1) port, and the drive may be a 3.0Gbps (sometimes called SATA 2) drive. A cable converter may be necessary. Laptops sometimes have combination USB/SATA ports called eSATAp ports. eSATA ports are sometimes disabled in BIOS and sometimes require BIOS changes, updates, and/or device drivers. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig34">Figure 7.34</a> shows an external hard drive that supports IEEE 1394 (FireWire), eSATA, and USB as you can see from the ports on the back of the unit.</p>

<p class="noindent">Configure a parallel SCSI device by doing the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Setting the proper SCSI ID</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Terminating both ends of the SCSI chain</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Connecting the proper cable(s)</p>
<p class="indent">The parallel SCSI chain consists of several SCSI devices cabled together. The SCSI chain includes SCSI devices and a single controller, sometimes called a host adapter. The SCSI controller is usually a separate adapter, but it may be built into the motherboard. The SCSI chain includes internal SCSI devices that connect to the SCSI host adapter and any external SCSI devices that connect to an adapterâs external port. Multiple SCSI chains can exist in a system, and a computer can contain up to four SCSI host adapters. A SCSI-1 host adapter supports up to seven internal or external devices. SCSI-2 or higher adapters support up to 15 internal or external devices.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec16"><span class="pd_blue">SCSI ID Configuration and Termination</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Each device on a SCSI chain, including the SCSI host adapter, is assigned a <strong><a id="ch07term65" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0862" class="pd_blue">SCSI ID</a></strong>. (Some SCSI hard drive manufacturers refer to this setting as the drive select ID.) The SCSI ID allows each device to share the same SCSI bus, and it assigns a priority for each device. The SCSI interface allows a SCSI device to communicate directly with another SCSI device connected on the same SCSI chain. The higher the SCSI number, the higher the priority of the device on the SCSI chain. SCSI IDs are normally set using switches, jumpers, SCSI BIOS software, or manufacturer-provided software.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Power on all external SCSI devices <em>before</em> turning on the computer</span></p>
<p class="notepara">The host adapter detects all SCSI devices along the SCSI chain during the boot process. However, if a SCSI device is not used frequently the device can be powered off. The rest of the SCSI devices operate even if a SCSI device is powered off. If two devices have the same SCSI ID, a SCSI ID conflict occurs and the devices will not work properly. Setting an improper SCSI ID (priority) setting results in slower SCSI device performance.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Standard SCSI devices (8-bit devices) recognize SCSI IDs 0 through 7. Wide SCSI devices (16-bit devices) recognize SCSI IDs 0 through 15. The SCSI ID priority values are as follows from highest priority value to lowest. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig36">Figure 7.36</a> shows the SCSI priority numbers, from highest to lowest.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig36"></a><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/07fig36.jpg" alt="Image" width="595" height="88"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 7.36.</span> SCSI ID priority levels</p>
<p class="indent">The SCSI host adapter is normally preset to SCSI ID 7, the highest priority, and should not be changed. Slower devices such as scanners, optical drives, or video encoders should be assigned a higher SCSI ID such as 6 or 5 for a standard SCSI device and 15 or 14 for a Wide SCSI device, so they receive ample time to move data onto the SCSI bus. SCSI ID 0 is the default for most SCSI hard drives. A development that is helpful in setting SCSI IDs is SCAM (SCSI Configured AutoMatically).</p>
<p class="indent">Termination of SCSI devices is very important. Proper termination of SCSI devices keeps the signals from bouncing back up the cable and provides the proper electrical current level for the SCSI chain. The SCSI bus cannot operate properly without terminating both ends of the SCSI bus. Improper termination can make one, many, or all SCSI devices not work properly. Over time, improper termination can damage a SCSI adapter or a SCSI device. SCSI termination is performed in several ways: (1) by installing a SIPP (single inline pin package), <a id="page_277"></a>(2) by installing a jumper, (3) by setting a switch, (4) by installing a terminator plug, (5) by installing a pass through terminator, or (6) with software.</p>
<p class="indent">When setting or removing termination, refer to the documentation included with the adapter or device. If the terminator to an external SCSI device is not provided with the device, it must be purchased separately. Some internal SCSI cables do not have a terminator built into them.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig37">Figure 7.37</a> shows a SCSI hard drive. The SCSI ID configuration is shown with the diagram on the bottom-right side.</p>

If both internal and external devices attach to the SCSI host adapter, the last internal device connected to the SCSI cable is terminated as well as the last external device. All other devices and the SCSI host adapter must have their terminators removed. The SCSI chain in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig39">Figure 7.39</a> consists of two internal SCSI devices (a CD drive and a hard drive) and two external SCSI devices (a tape drive and a scanner). The two ends of the SCSI chain that must be terminated are the CD drive and the scanner. All other devices are not terminated. Note that some SCSI adapters stay terminated even if they are in the middle of the chain or they treat the external chain as one SCSI bus and the internal chain as a separate SCSI bus.

<p class="noindent">Parallel SCSI cabling allows multiple devices to be connected to one SCSI host adapter and share the same SCSI bus; this is called daisy chaining. Daisy chaining is like connecting multiple Christmas light sets together. If multiple internal SCSI devices attach to the SCSI adapter, then use an internal SCSI cable with multiple connectors. Most internal SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 cables are 50-pin ribbon cables. Internal SCSI-3 cables are 68-pin ribbon cables.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">To connect external SCSI-1 devices, a 50-pin Centronics to 50-pin Centronics cable is used. The SCSI-1 cable is also known as an A Cable. The SCSI-2 standard has a 50-pin D-shell connector that connects to the SCSI host adapter and a Centronics connector that connects to the external device. For 16-bit SCSI devices, a second 68-pin cable, called the B Cable, must be used in addition to the A Cable. SCSI-3 has a 68-pin cable called the P Cable. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig40">Figure 7.40</a> illustrates some SCSI cables.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec18"><span class="pd_blue">SAS Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">SAS drives are probably the easiest drives of all to install. They normally install into a server, but some business computers and home computers that need a reliable hard drive that lasts longer than the other types will pay the additional money for a SAS drive. SAS drives normally do not require data or power cables to be attached. They get power through the SAS host connection in the computer. That is why drives are normally mounted in hard drive slots or bays on servers. Most home and business computers donât have SAS host interfaces. A cable can be bought and the maximum length is 13.1 feet (4 meters). Also, the drive might have to be installed into a SAS tray or carrier before you can slide into the computer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig41">Figure 7.41</a> shows a server that has two bays for SAS drives.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_281"></a>An interesting point about SAS is that some SAS connectors can accept SATA 3 devices. However, the reverse is not trueâyou cannot attach a SAS device to a SATA connector.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec19"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Storage</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Laptops traditionally had a PATA or SATA hard drive installed, but today they have an SSD instead of or in addition to these hard drive types. Other mobile devices such as ultrabooks and netbooks use SSDs as well. A mini PCI or PCIe adapter can be used to connect the drive to the system, or the drive can be directly attached to the motherboard. Additional storage can be provided by devices that connect to USB, eSATA, eSATAp, or IEEE 1394 ports. PC Cards or ExpressCard hard drives can also be used to provide storage expansion. For external drives, attach the drive to external power if necessary. Some USB devices use external power, some are powered and connect to one USB port, while still others require two USB ports. Some manufacturers may require you to install software before attaching the drive. Once installed, use Device Manager to ensure the drive is recognized by the operating system. If the drive is a FireWire device, the drive may appear under the IEEE 1394 Devices section of Device Manager.</p>
<p class="indent">Two methods are used with hard drives installed in portable computers: proprietary or removable. With a proprietary installation, the hard drive is installed in a location where it cannot be changed, configured, or moved very easily. Proprietary cables and connectors are used. With removable hard drives, the laptop has a hard drive bay that allows installation/removal through a single connector that provides power as well as data signaling. Otherwise, the drive could have separate data and power connectors. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig42">Figure 7.42</a> shows an internal SATA hard drive that is used in a portable computer.</p>

<p class="indent">Hard drives are normally configured using the Auto-Detect feature included with BIOS. The Auto-Detect feature automatically determines the drive type for the system. For SCSI hard drive installations, sometimes the BIOS setting is type 0 or None. Once the system boots, the SCSI controllerâs BIOS initializes and the SCSI hard drive takes over and boots the system. Even though the drive type number is set to 0 or None, if this step is omitted, the hard drive will not operate.</p>

This allows the drive to accept data from the operating system.

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec22"><span class="pd_blue">Partitioning</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first step in preparing a hard drive for use is partitioning. Partitioning a hard drive divides the drive so the computer system sees the hard drive as more than one drive. DOS and Windows 9x have a software program called <code>FDISK</code> that partitions hard drives. That process has been replaced by the <strong><a id="ch07term19" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0250" class="pd_blue">Disk Management</a></strong> program that is available after the operating system is installed, or by using the <span class="EmpStrong"><a id="ch07term21" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0252" class="pd_blue">diskpart</a></span> utility from the command line. Disk Management is normally used to partition additional hard drives and to manage all of them. The first hard drive in the system is normally partitioned as part of the Windows installation process. Additional partitions can be created using Disk Management once the operating system is installed.</p>
<p class="indent">Partitioning provides advantages such as the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Dividing a hard drive into separate subunits that are then assigned drive letters, such as <code>C:</code> or <code>D:</code>, by the operating system</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Organizing the hard drive to separate multiple operating systems, applications, and data</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Providing data security by placing data in a different partition to allow ease of backup as well as protection</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Using the hard drive to its fullest capacity</p>
<p class="indent">The original purpose of partitioning was to allow for loading multiple operating systems. This is still a good reason today because placing each operating system in its own partition eliminates the crashes and headaches caused by multiple operating systems and multiple applications coexisting in the same partition. The type of partition and how big the partition can be depends on the file system being used. A <strong><a id="ch07term32" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0367" class="pd_blue">file system</a></strong> defines how data is stored on a drive. The most common Windows file systems are FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS. The file system that can be used depends on what operating system is installed, whether the device is an internal device or external, and whether files are to be shared. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07tab05">Table 7.5</a> lists file systems and explains a little about each one.</p>

<p class="indent">Applications should be in a separate partition from data files. The following are some good reasons for partitioning the hard drive and separating data files from application files:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Multiple partitions on the same hard drive divide the drive into smaller subunits, which makes it easier and faster to back up the data (which should be backed up more often than applications).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The data is protected from operating system failures, unstable software applications, and any unusual software problems that occur between the application and the operating system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The data is in one location, which makes the files easier and faster to back up, organize, and locate.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_286"></a>FAT32 partitions have been around a long time and are still used. Flash drives are commonly formatted for FAT32 due to the NTFS âlazy write,â which prolongs a write and might not release an external drive for some time. The FAT32 file system makes more efficient use of the hard drive than FAT16. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07tab07">Table 7.7</a> shows the cluster size for FAT32 partitions.</p>

Logical drives created in the extended partition are assigned drive letters such as <code>D:</code>, <code>E:</code>, or others. The only limit for logical drives is the number of drive letters. An extended partition can have a maximum of 23 logical drives with the drive letters <code>D:</code> through <code>Z:</code>.

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec23"><span class="pd_blue">How Drive Letters Are Assigned</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An operating system assigns drive letters to hard drives during the partitioning step. The order in which the partitions are assigned drive letters depends on three factors: (1) the number of hard drives, (2) the type of partitions on the hard drives (primary or extended), and (3) the operating system.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_290"></a>Note that if a new drive is installed, drive letters for devices, volumes, partitions, or logical drives are added afterward. Drive letters can be changed through the Disk Management tool (right-click on the drive letter) or by using the <code>diskpart</code> command-line utility. Be careful, though, because some applications have pointers to specific files on a specific drive letter. Special products can be used that partition the hard drive and allow repartitioning without any data loss. Examples include Acronisâs Disk Director, EaseUSâs Partition Master, and Avanquestâs Partition Commander.</p>

Fault tolerance is the ability to continue functioning after a hardware or software failure. A RAID array can be implemented with hardware or software. Hardware RAID is configured through the BIOS. Generic hardware RAID steps are as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Ensure that the motherboard ports that you want to use are enabled.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Ensure that you have RAID drivers for the hard drives used in the RAID.</p>

If you want to be able to control the RAID through Windows and resize the volumes or make adjustments, then use a software RAID. A lab at the end of the chapter helps with this concept.</p>
<p class="indent">RAID comes in many different levels, but the ones implemented in the Windows environment are 0, 1, and 5. Windows XP supports simple, spanned, and striped volumes. Windows Vista Business and higher support simple, spanned and striped volumes. Windows 7 Professional and higher supports simple, spanned, striped, and mirrored volumes. Keep in mind that a spanned volume does not provide redundancy or fault tolerance like most of <a id="page_292"></a>the RAID levels do. Some motherboards support ânestedâ RAID, which means RAID levels are combined.

With RAID 0, blocks of data (B1, B2, B3, etc.) are placed on alternating drives. With RAID 1, the same block of data is written to two drives.

<p class="noindent">The second step in preparing a hard drive for use is high-level formatting. A high-level format must be performed on all primary partitions, logical drives located within extended partitions, and GPT partitions before data can be written to the hard drive. The high-level format sets up the file system so it can accept data.</p>
<p class="indent">NTFS allows support for multiple data streams and support for every character in the world. NTFS also automatically remaps bad clusters to other sections of the hard drive without any additional time or utility. During the installation process, Windows allows for a <strong><a id="ch07term52" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0780" class="pd_blue">quick format</a></strong> (where you see the word â(quick)â after the option) or a full format (sometimes called a standard format).

This prevents the operating system from being installed on a sector that may cause operating system issues. The quick format simply prepares the drive for data and takes a lot less time than a full format. Use the full format if you suspect the drive has issues. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig50">Figure 7.50</a> shows the difference between how a FAT16 partition and an NTFS partition is set up when the high-level formatting is completed.</p>

<p class="noindent">Because many hard drives are mechanical devices, they make noises. Sometimes these noises are because the hard drive is being used too much as virtual memory due to a lack of physical RAM. Some noises are normal and some are an indication of problems, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig51">Figure 7.51</a>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 7.51.</span> Hard drive noises</p>
<p class="indent">Most problems with new drive installation stem from improper configuration of jumpers on PATA drives or problems with cabling. The following tips assist with checking possible problems.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the physical settings, if necessary (power cable, jumper settings, secure data cable, data cable pin 1 orientation, and device placement on data cable).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the drive type setting in BIOS Setup and ensure that the ports are enabled (especially SATA ports).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If after you have configured the drive, installed it, and powered it on, the BIOS shows the drive type as âNone, Not installed,â or displays all 0s in the drive parameters even though you set it to automatically detect the drive, then the BIOS is not able to detect it. Check BIOS SATA mode and BIOS version. Check all jumper settings, check cable connection(s), and check the power connection. If two PATA drives connect to the same cable, disconnect the slave drive. In Setup, reduce any advanced features to their lowest values or disable them. Increase the amount of time the computer takes to initialize the hard drive by going into Setup and modifying such features as hard drive boot delay or set the boot speed to the lowest value. This gives the hard drive more time to spin up and reach its appropriate RPM before data is read from it. Make sure the motherboard port is enabled.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Has the drive been partitioned and one partition marked as the active partition? Has the drive been high-level formatted?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Verify that the mounting screw to hold the drive in the case is not too tight. Loosen the screw and power up the computer. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig52">Figure 7.52</a> shows the mounting screws for a hard drive installed in a tower case.</p>

<p class="notepara">If your computer has a boot sector virus or data cannot be read from the paging file, run antivirus software for the potential virus. If there is a paging file error such as the one shown, search for the error code on the Internet.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_296"></a>â¢ If during partitioning the âNo fixed disks presentâ error appears, check the hard drive cabling, power connection, configuration jumpers, and BIOS configuration.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the hard drive does not format to full capacity, (a) your BIOS may not support the larger drive and/or the BIOS must be upgraded, or (b) you have selected a file system that does not support larger partitions, or you need an updated driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If on initial boot after setting up a hard drive in BIOS Setup, you see the message âHDD Controller Failure, Press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/f1.jpg" alt="Image" width="24" height="21"></span> to continue,â the system is not partitioned or high-level formatted. Press the necessary key and boot from a disc and then partition and high-level format the hard drive. If the message continues, check the cabling and/or jumper configuration(s) on the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If during power-on the hard drive does not spin up or the hard drive spins down after a few seconds, check the power connector, the data cable, the drive recognized in BIOS, jumper settings, energy management jumpers or settings in Setup, and any software that came with the drive that enables power management. Disable power management in BIOS and/or the operating system. Try installing the drive in another system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the system locks or you get a BSOD (blue screen of death), write down the code, if any, and try a warm boot (<span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/ctrl.jpg" alt="Image" width="34" height="21"></span>+<span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_297"></a>The following are generic guidelines for hard drives that have worked but are now having problems:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Run a virus-checking program after booting from a virus-free boot disk. Many viruses are specifically designed to attack the hard drive. If you have to wipe the hard drive to ensure the virus is erased before reinstalling the operating system, applications, and data, ensure you do a full format and not a quick one as part of the operating system installation process.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Does your hard drive stick?</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Place a hand on top of the drive as you turn on the computer. Does the drive spin at all? If not, the problem is probably a âstickyâ drive or a bad drive. A hard drive must spin at a certain rpm before the heads move over the surface of the hard drive. To check if the drive is sticking, remove the drive and try spinning the spindle motor by hand. Otherwise, remove the drive, hold the drive in your hand, and give a quick jerk with your wrist. Another trick that works is to remove the hard drive from the case, place the drive in a plastic bag, and put in the freezer for a couple of hours. Then, remove the drive and allow it to warm up to room temperature. Re-install the drive into the system and try it.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Has there been a recent cleaning of the computer or has someone recently removed the top from the computer? If so, check all cables and verify that they correctly connect pin 1 to pin 1 of the adapter or motherboard. Check the power connection to the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the hard drive flashes quickly on boot up, the controller is trying to read the partition table in the master boot record. If this information is not found, various symptoms can be shown, such as the error messages âInvalid boot disk,â âInaccessible boot device,â âInvalid partition table,â âError loading operating system,â âMissing operating system,â or âNo operating system found.â Use the <code>DISKPART</code> command from recovery console or Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to see if the hard drive partition table is okay. Try running <code>FDISK /MBR</code> from Recovery Console (XP), <code>bootrec /FixMbr</code> (Vista/7) or use a hard drive utility to repair the partition table.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do you receive a message such as âDisk Boot Failure,â âNon-System Disk,â or âDisk Errorâ? These errors may indicate a boot record problem. The solution is to boot from a bootable disk or CD to see if drive <code>C:</code> is available. The operating system may have to be reloaded. Also, verify that the primary partition is marked as active.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you receive a message âHard drive not found,â âNo boot device available,â âFixed disk error,â or âDisk boot failure,â the BIOS cannot find the hard drive. Check cabling.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When Windows has startup problems, Recovery Console and the <em>Advanced Options</em> menu are used. Many times startup problems are due to a virus. Other utilities that help with MBR, boot sector, and system files are <code>FIXBOOT</code>, <code>FIXMBR</code>, System File Checker, and the <em>Advanced Boot Options</em> menu. To use <code>FIXBOOT</code>, type the <code>FIXBOOT x:</code> command, where <code>x:</code> is the drive letter of the volume that has the problem. To use <code>FIXMBR</code>, type <code>FIXMBR</code> from a command prompt. <code>FIXBOOT</code> is used in XP Recovery Console to rewrite the boot sector. Vista and 7 use <code>bootrec /Fixmbr</code> or <code>bootrec /Fixboot</code> from the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</p>

The System File Checker is also needed after removing some viruses.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The following messages indicate problems with the master boot record or the system files: âInvalid partition table,â âError loading operating system,â âMissing operating system,â or âA disk read error has occurred.â In Windows XP, an additional two messages could be âNTLDR is missingâ or âNTLDR is corrupt.â</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When Windows has startup problems due to incompatible hardware or software or a corrupted installation process, the <em>Advanced Boot Options</em> menu can help. This option can be selected by pressing the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/f8.jpg" alt="Image" width="26" height="20"></span> key during the boot process.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_298"></a>â¢ If an insufficient disk space error appears or performance is bad (slow response), delete unnecessary files, including .tmp files, from the hard drive, empty the Recycle Bin, and save files to an optical disk, a flash drive, or an external hard drive and remove the moved files from the hard drive. Use the Disk Cleanup and Defragmenter tool. Another option is to add another hard drive and move some (or all) data files to it.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For eSATA drives, check the power cabling and data cabling. Ensure that the data cable is the correct type for the port and device being used. Partition and format the drive before data is written to it. Ensure that the port is enabled through BIOS. The BIOS may require an update, or a device driver may be required (especially if the drive is listed under âother devicesâ in Device Manager). BIOS incompatibilities are the most common issue with installations. Note that some operating systems report SATA drives as SCSI drives.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer reports that the hard drive may have a defective area or if you start getting read/write failure notices, right-click on the hard drive volume &gt; <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Tools</em> tab &gt; <em>Check now</em>. The drive may need to be replaced soon.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If drives fail frequently in a particular computer, check for heat problems, power fluctuations, vibrations, improper mounting screws or hardware that might cause vibrations, and environmental issues such as dust, heat, magnetic fields, smoke, and nearby motors. Consider an SSD if the computer is in a harsh environment.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec28"><a id="page_299"></a><span class="pd_blue">RAID Issues</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you add a RAID to a computer, you increase the complexity of the disk management. When two hard drives are configured in a RAID, they are seen as one volume and managed as one volume. Multiply that by the different types of RAID and the number of hard drives involved in the RAID, and you have a real opportunity for some fun issues. The following issues can help you with RAID configurations:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you have done RAID through the BIOS, you cannot manage the RAID through Windows (it is grayed out and shows as no fault tolerance). If you want to manage the RAID through Windows, you will have to break the RAID in BIOS (remove the RAID) and then re-create the RAID in Windows. Backup your data before doing this.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Sometimes as part of the RAID configuration, you need a driver disk for the Windows installation or RAID failure troubleshooting process. Follow the motherboard or RAID adapter manufacturerâs directions on how to create this disk (usually a USB drive or optical disc even though the directions on the screen may say floppy disk).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If Windows wonât allow you or give you the option to do a RAID, check BIOS settings and ensure that AHCI has been enabled for the drives.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If disk mirroring isnât an option in Windows Disk Management, check your Windows version. You must have a Windows Professional or higher edition to do the RAID.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows 7 is already installed in a system. If you install a hardware RAID through BIOS and use the Windows 7 drive in the RAID, Windows will no longer boot and you see a BSOD (blue screen of death). If you want to keep the hardware RAID, re-install Windows 7. You may have to get drivers before doing this. If you want Windows 7 to boot again, remove the hardware RAID. You can also use the BSOD code shown to research the error.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec29"><span class="pd_blue">Preventive Maintenance for Hard Drives</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Keeping a computer system in a clean and cool operating environment extends the life of the hard drive. The most common hard drive failures are due to moving parts (heads and motors) and power fluctuations and/or failures. Performing preventive maintenance on the entire computer is good for all components found inside the computer, including the hard drive subsystem.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_300"></a>Windows has three great tools to use in hard drive preventive maintenance (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig53">Figure 7.53</a>): Error-checking (<em>Check now</em> button), Disk Cleanup, and Disk Defragmenter.

<p class="indent">Over time, as files are added to a hard drive, the files become fragmented, which means the clusters that make up the file are not adjacent to one another. Fragmentation slows down the hard drive in two ways: (1) the FAT has to keep track of scattered clusters and (2) the hard drive read/write head assembly must move to different locations on the driveâs surface to access a single file. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig54">Figure 7.54</a> illustrates fragmentation of three files (F1, F2, and F3) and the results after defragmentation has been executed on the hard drive. <strong><a id="ch07term14" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0218" class="pd_blue">Defragmentation</a></strong> is the process of placing files in contiguous sectors.

<p class="indent">You should periodically defragment files on a mechanical PATA or SATA hard drive. Users who delete files often and have large files that are constantly revised should especially make use of the defragmentation tool.

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec30"><span class="pd_blue">Data Security</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another preventive maintenance procedure for a hard drive is performing a backup of the data and operating system. Most people do not realize that the most important part of any computer is the data that resides within it (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07fig55">Figure 7.55</a>). Data cannot be replaced as hardware can be. Traditionally, backups have been saved to magnetic tapeâquarter-inch cartridge, LTO (linear tape-open) or DLT (digital linear tape) being the most common typesâbut CDs, DVDs, BDs, and external drives are viable alternatives today. Some people use optical discs to back up the data and periodically do a full backup to an external drive.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 7.55.</span> Keeping your data safe</p>
<p class="indent">The following tips help with protecting the operating system and data:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Backups use the file archive bit. A <strong><a id="ch07term33" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0396" class="pd_blue">full backup</a></strong> backs up all selected files and sets the archive bit to off.

The files selected are the ones that have the archive bit set to on. The backup software resets those archive bits to off. A <strong><a id="ch07term15" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0233" class="pd_blue">differential backup</a></strong> backs up files that have changed since the last full backup (files that have the archive bit set to on), but the backup software does not reset the archive bit like the incremental backup does.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ensure that operating system and application service packs and updates are applied regularly.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Install antivirus software and keep the virus definitions updated.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have an alternate boot source (optical disc, thumb drive, another hard drive, operating system discs, etc.).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use <strong><a id="ch07term04" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0083" class="pd_blue">BitLocker</a></strong> drive encryption to protect an entire disk volume including the operating system, user files, swap files, and hibernation files. It is available on Vista/7 Enterprise and Ultimate, and Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise. BitLocker requires two NTFS disk partitions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Place operating system files and data files on separate hard drive partitions/volumes to make backups easier to manage.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do backups routinely. Have a routine maintenance plan that you recommend to users. Important data should be backed up daily or frequently, but routine data is usually handled by a monthly backup. The sensitivity and importance of the data determines how frequent backups are performed.</p>

Furthermore, the hard drive partitions need to be deleted and re-created. Some hard drive manufacturers have a utility that rewrites (sometimes called <span class="pd_blue"><strong><a id="ch07term48">overwrites</a></strong></span>) the hard drive with all 1s or all 0s to prevent data remnants from being recovered. You can use the SDelete utility that can be downloaded from Microsoft (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897443.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897443.aspx</a>) or use the <code>format</code> and <code>cipher</code> commands. <code>Format</code> <span class="EmpItalic">x</span><code>: /p:</code><span class="EmpItalic">n</span> (where <span class="EmpItalic">x:</span> is the drive letter and <span class="EmpItalic">n</span> is the <a id="page_303"></a>number of passes) to format a disk volume with a zero in every sector. Then use the <code>cipher /w</code> <span class="EmpItalic">x:</span> command, where <span class="EmpItalic">x:</span> is the hard drive volume letter. The <code>cipher</code> command writes all unused sectors with 0s, then 1s, and then a random number. Because this command is performed on unused sectors, it is important to remember to use the format command first. A degaussing tool can also be used. Degaussing uses electromagnets to change the magnetic field of the platters.</p>

<p class="indent">Probably the most asked question of those with hard drive failures or failing/failed sectors is regarding file recovery. Windows does not have file recovery software other than locating and repairing lost clusters. However, there are third-party file recovery utilities that can be used. Many times files cannot be recovered unless the file recovery utility was installed prior to the loss. There are companies that provide data recovery services.</p>
<p class="indent">Mobile devices sometimes have an additional password for their hard drive. That way, if the device is stolen, the hard drive cannot be inserted into another device and used without knowing the hard drive password. It is a password in addition to the power on password or Windows password. If this option is available, it is configured through the BIOS.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 7. Storage Devices_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Donât use the same hard drive as a backup device</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Backing up data to a different partition on a hard drive is <em>not</em> a good idea. Even though there is some chance that your data might be saved, it is more likely the drive will fail. The drive is a physical device that may have moving partsâmotor, heads, and so on. Mechanical failure is always a possibility.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Even though much data is stored locally for most users, many companies are favoring centralized storage even for individual users. This protects the companyâs interest, and it also ensures that backups are done on a regular and reliable basis. Another option in business is a thin-client environment in which no hard drives are included with the system. Storage is provided across the network. This reduces hardware and software costs and PC maintenance staffing costs, and it makes data security easier to manage.</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec31"><span class="pd_blue">Removable Drive Storage</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">IDE and SCSI have been the two most common types of hard drives, but these interfaces have also been used for internal and external storage devices such as optical drives and tape drives. IDE PATA has traditionally only been used for internal devices, but now with SATA, external devices are available. SCSI has always supported internal and external devices. These external devices can also attach to the parallel port (not common today) or the USB port (a very popular option).</p>
<p class="indent">Tape drives can be attached using SCSI or IDE (SATA only) or can attach to parallel, USB, eSATA, or IEEE 1394 ports if they are external devices. Tape drives are installed using similar methods of like devices that use these ports. When tapes are used, the most common types of tapes used for backups are DAT (digital audio tape) and Traven. The most common type of removable storage is optical (CD/DVD/BD).</p>

<p class="notepara">Many folks, especially those who travel frequently, use data storage servers at their company or use the services of an Internet storage site. The services of such a site include backing up the data stored on their drives and having redundant hard drives in their servers. This is known as cloud storage or offsite storage.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec32"><span class="pd_blue">Disk Caching/Virtual Memory</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An easy way to speed up the hard drive is to create a <strong><a id="ch07term17" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0247" class="pd_blue">disk cache</a></strong>. This puts data into RAM where it can be retrieved much faster than if the data is still on the hard drive. When data is read from the hard drive, the next requested data is frequently located in the adjacent clusters. Disk caching reads more data from the hard drive than requested. The data is placed in a reserved portion of RAM called the cache. Cache on a hard drive controller, sometimes called a data buffer, allows the read/write heads to read more than just one sector at a time. A hard drive can read up to an entire track of information and hold this data until needed without returning to the hard drive for each sector.</p>
<p class="indent">Both IDE and SCSI drives can contain 2MB to 128MB or more of RAM (cache memory). Because many drives are mechanical devices, they take time to reorder write data to the platters. With cache memory installed, information can be prefetched from the computerâs system RAM and stored in the hard driveâs cache memory. This frees up the system RAM for other tasks and improves the system and hard driveâs performance.</p>
<p class="indent">A different way of using a hard drive is with virtual memory. Virtual memory is a method of using hard disk space as if it were RAM. The amount of RAM installed in a system is not normally enough to handle all of the operating system and the multiple applications that are opened and being used. Only the program and data of the application that is currently being used is what is in RAM. The rest of the open applications and data are stored in what is called a swap file or a page file on the hard drive. When you click over to a different application that is held in the swap/page file, data is moved from RAM into the swap file and the data you need to look at is moved into RAM for faster access and data manipulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows uses VMM (Virtual Memory Manager). The disk cache is dynamicâit increases or decreases the cache size as needed. If the system begins to page (constantly swapping data from RAM to the hard drive), the cache size automatically shrinks. In Windows, the virtual memory swap file (sometimes called the page file) is called <code>PAGEFILE.SYS</code>. To manually configure virtual memory in Windows 7, right-click <em>Computer</em> &gt; <em>Properties</em> &gt; in left pane, select <em>Advanced system settings</em> &gt; <em>Advanced</em> tab &gt; in the <em>Virtual memory</em> section, click <em>Change</em>. Then, to manually configure the settings, clear <em>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</em> and adjust the settings as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">32-bit Windows versions use 32-bit demand-paged virtual memory, and each process gets 4GB of address space divided into two 2GB sections. One 2GB section is shared with the rest of the system while the other 2GB section is reserved for the one application. All the memory space is divided into 4KB blocks of memory called âpages.â The operating system allocates as much available RAM as possible to an application. Then, the operating system swaps or pages the application to and from the temporary swap file as needed. The operating system determines the optimum setting for this swap file; however, the swap file size can be changed. Look back to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06fig17">Figure 6.17</a> in the Memory chapter (<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>) to review this concept.</p>

<p class="notepara">If multiple hard drives are available, a technician might want to move the swap file to a different drive. Always put the swap file on the fastest hard drive, unless that hard drive lacks space. The swap file can reside on multiple hard drives. It is best to keep the swap file on a hard drive that does not contain the operating system.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">64-bit Windows can have 2 or 4GB for each 32-bit process. For 64-bit software, 7 or 8TB is the maximum. The operating system kernel gets 8TB maximum.</p>

<h3 id="ch07lev1sec33"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâPhone Skills</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Technicians must frequently use the phone in the normal course of business. This includes speaking with customers who call in, those who you must call, and vendors and technical support staff. Many techniciansâ full-time job involves communication via the telephone.</p>
<p class="indent">Phone communication is different from in-person communication because on the phone you have only your words and voice intonation to convey concepts, professionalism, and technical assistance. When dealing with someone in person, you can use some of the following techniques that are not allowed during normal phone conversations:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Gesture to emphasize points.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Draw a graphic to illustrate a concept.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Perform steps needed for troubleshooting faster because you can do them rather than step someone through them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Show empathy more easily with your body language, actions, and voice.</p>
<p class="indent">When dealing with someone on the phone, the following pointers can help. Some of the tips apply to everyday technical support as well:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Identify yourself clearly and pleasantly.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid using a condescending tone.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Be patient and speak slowly when giving directions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use active listening skills (covered in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>); avoid doing other tasks when on a call with someone.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid using acronyms and technical jargon.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid being accusatory or threatening.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the customer is irate, try to calm him down and help him; however, if he continues to be belligerent, turn the call over to your supervisor.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Escalate the problem if it is beyond your skill level; do not waste the customerâs time.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not leave people on hold for extended periods without checking back with them and updating them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Speak clearly and loud enough to be heard easily.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid having a headset microphone pulled away so it is hard to hear you; if you are asked to repeat something, speak louder or adjust the microphone or handset.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid eating, drinking, or chewing gum when on the phone.</p>
<p class="indent">Good interpersonal skills are even more important when on the phone than with face-to-face interactions. Before getting on the phone, take a deep breath and check your attitude. Every customer deserves your best game, no matter what type of day you have had or what type of customer you have previously spoken to.</p>
<p class="indent">The rest of this chapter is devoted to questions and exercises to help with storage concepts. Good luck with them!</p>
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec34"><a id="page_306"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you have to replace a floppy drive, attach the drive to the last connector (the one after the twist) but clean the heads first before replacing in case that is causing the problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Hard drive form factors include 3.5-, 2.5-, and 1.8-inch drives. Hard drives come in different speeds: 5400, 7200, 10,000, and 15,000 rpm. The faster the rpm, the more money the drive normally cost, but the drive transfers data faster.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Common drives today are PATA, SATA, and SSD for desktop and mobile computers. SCSI used to be used in servers and some desktops, but has evolved to SAS for servers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ PATA drives are internal only, connect to a 40-pin ribbon cable that can have two devices per motherboard connector/cable. Multiple motherboard connectors can be present and are called primary, secondary, tertiary, and so on in BIOS.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ PATA drives are configured using jumpers. The devices on one cable must be configured as either master and slave or both as cable select. If cable select is used, the master device must connect to the end of the cable. An 80-conductor, 40-pin cable is used today. PATA drives use Molex power connectors.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SATA drives can be internal or external and connect using a 9-pin 3.3 feet (1 meter) maximum internal connector, an external eSATA connector (3.3-foot [1-meter] maximum for 1.5Gbps devices and 6.56-foot [2-meter] maximum for 3 or 6Gbps devices), or an eSATAp combo eSATA/USB port. SATA 1 (I) drives operate at a maximum of 1.5Gbps, SATA 2 (II) drives at 3Gbps, and SATA 3 (III) drives at 6Gbps. SATA internal drives use a unique SATA power connector. A Molex to SATA converter can be purchased, but 3.3 volts is not supplied to the drive; most drives do not use the 3.3-volt line. External drives use an external power source unless plugged into an eSATAp combo port, which can provide power.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SATA drives require no jumper, and only one device can connect to a SATA motherboard/adapter port.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SSD drives have become more common in desktops, laptops, netbooks, and ultrabooks. They are often used in harsh environments, dirty environments, heavy movement environments, and harsh temperature environments. They are extremely fast, but expensive and connect using PATA, SATA, USB, eSATA, or IEEE 1394 (FireWire) connections.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ SSD drives erase data in blocks instead of by marking available clusters in the FAT with traditional drives. SSD drives should not be defragmented. SSD drives use various technologies to ensure functionality such as that all of the memory gets used evenly (wear leveling) and reserved spare memory blocks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Hard drives must be partitioned and high-level formatted before they can be used to store data.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Partitioning separates the drive into smaller sections that can receive drive letters. The smaller the partition the smaller the cluster size. A cluster is the smallest space for a single file to reside. A cluster consists of four or more sectors. Each sector contains 512 bytes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Partitioning can be done through the Windows installation process or using the Disk Management tool.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Several hard drive divisions are available using partitioning: primary, extended, and logical drives. Logical drives reside within the extended partition. Logical drives and primary partitions receive drive letters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_307"></a>â¢ An HPA or protected partition may be used for system recovery by computer manufacturers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Multiple drives can be configured in a hardware or software RAID implementation. Hardware RAID is done through using the BIOS or a RAID adapter. Software RAID is done using the Windows Disk Management tool.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Spanning is supported in Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 7 Professional and higher. Spanning is simply configuring more than one hard drive and making it appear to the operating system as one drive; data fills the first drive than the second drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ RAID 0 or disk striping does not provide fault tolerance, but does provide fast efficient use of two or more drives.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ RAID 1 is disk mirroring and this method does provide fault tolerance by having an exact copy of a drive in case one drive fails.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ RAID 5 is disk striping with parity where parity data is kept on one of the three minimum drives. This parity data can be used to rebuild one drive if one of three or more drives fail.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ File systems in use are FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS. FAT32 and exFAT are used for external drives such as flash thumb drives. NTFS is used for internal drives and provides features such as better cluster management, security, compression, and encryption.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive or computer is to be donated or recycled, erase corporate and personal data from the drive. Delete all data, delete all partitions, use a drive wiping and overwriting utility. Physically destroy (shred, drill, and degauss or use electromagnetism) the platters if the drive contained extremely sensitive data.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive fails to be recognized as a new installation, check cabling and BIOS settings especially for a disabled SATA port.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Normal mechanical drive noises include a clicking when going into sleep mode or being powered down due to self-parking heads.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Abnormal drive noises include a couple of clicks with a POST beep and/or error, repeated clicking noises, high frequency vibration due to improper or poor mounting hardware, and high pitched whining sound.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a drive fails after operating for a while, check for a virus. See if the BIOS has a virus checker. Try a warm boot to see if the drive has not spun up to speed yet. Check cabling, especially on SATA. Review any recent changes. Use the Windows Advanced Boot Options menu, Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), System File Checker, and <code>fixboot</code>, <code>fixmbr</code>, <code>bootrec /Fixmbr</code>, and <code>bootrec /Fixboot</code> commands. Boot from an alternate source and check Disk Management for status messages related to the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Back up data onto a different drive. Keep critical data in an offsite location.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Hard drive space is used as RAM. Ensure enough storage space is available for the operating system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When speaking on the phone to anyone, be clear in your statements, donât use technical jargon, keep your tone professional, and do not do other tasks, including eating or drinking.</p>
