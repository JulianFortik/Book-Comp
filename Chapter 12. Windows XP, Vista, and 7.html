<h3 id="ch12lev1sec1"><a id="page_576"></a><span class="pd_blue">Windows XP Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As with other Windows versions that are available now, Windows XP is either a 32- or 64-bit OS (operating system). You might sometimes see the 32-bit version referred to as an x86 version. Microsoft created several different editions of Windows XP, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab01">Table 12.1</a> summarizes the differences.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch12tab01"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 12.1.</span> Windows XP editions</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/12tab01.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="573"></div>
<p class="indent">32-bit Windows XP supports 32-bit Windows applications, 16-bit applications, and some DOS applications (only those that do not access hardware directly); every 32-bit application runs in its own 2GB memory space; all 16-bit Windows applications run in a single virtual machine; a virtual machine simulates a single computer with its own memory, hardware devices, and software configuration. 64-bit Windows can do all of this in addition to supporting 64-bit applications.</p>
<p class="indent">DOS and 16-bit Windows applications run in a single 2GB memory space. The Windows XP VMM (virtual machine manager) handles allocating memory to applications. A single block called a page is 4KB. A <strong><a id="ch12term30" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0682" class="pd_blue">page file</a></strong> is used to store files and may also retrieve a file located on a disk. This file is called a paging file.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows XP supports <strong><a id="ch12term60" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1082" class="pd_blue">WFP</a></strong> (Windows file protection). WFP protects system files (files critical to the operating system) and some TrueType fonts. WFP runs in the background. When WFP detects that a file has been altered or deleted, it copies a replacement file from the Windows\System32\Dllcache folder, the Windows XP CD, or a network share (a shared folder that contains a copy of the XP CD).</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec2"><a id="page_577"></a><span class="pd_blue">Windows Vista/7 Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Like Windows XP, Vista, and 7 come in 32- and 64-bit versions: Starter (32-bit only), Home Basic, Home Premium, Business (Vista only), Professional (7 only), Enterprise, and Ultimate. Depending on the version, enhanced features include improved security; a graphical environment called <strong><a id="ch12term61" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1086" class="pd_blue">Windows Aero</a></strong> that includes a Windows sidebar that contains gadgets such as a clock, live thumbnails (hold your mouse over an application icon and all open documents are shown in a separate thumbnail), transparent icons (icons that you can see through), animations, and themes; quick access to tools and files; the Narrator (text-to-speech that reads the screen); an onscreen keyboard; the <strong><a id="ch12term54" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1022" class="pd_blue">UAC</a></strong> (User Account Control) to notify you of potential security issues before anything is added to or removed from the system; disk partitions that can be resized without loss of data; WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment) when things go wrong; and full support of IP version 6 (IPv6), the latest protocol for Internet communication. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig01">Figure 12.1</a> shows an example of the thumbnails and a Windows Aero desktop.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to use Windows Aero, the following minimum requirements must be met:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Vista/7 Home Premium or higher</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 1GHz 32-bit processor or higher</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 1GB of RAM or higher</p>

<p class="indent">Besides having to choose a Windows version, deciding on a 32-bit or 64-bit version is also required. This decision is based on the type of processor that is installed. Through Windows Explorer, right-click the computer and select <em>Properties</em> to see the current version. 64-bit processors have been available for some time, but a 64-bit operating system is a big step. It took over 12 years for a 32-bit operating system to become the norm in business and home computing environments. Even though Windows XP had a 64-bit version, many consumers have not considered using a 64-bit operating system until Windows Vista or 7. Many books and advertisements refer to a 32-bit processor as an x86 chip, so 32-bit editions might be seen or referred to as an x86 version. 64-bit processors are frequently shown as x64. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab03">Table 12.3</a> lists the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.</p>

<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 improve upon WFP with <strong><a id="ch12term66" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1104" class="pd_blue">WRP</a></strong> (Windows Resource Protection) that protects operating system files, folders, and important registry keys using ACLs (access control lists). Changes made to a monitored file or folder cannot be changed even by an administrator unless he or she takes ownership and adds the appropriate ACEs (access control entities). Any file that cannot be repaired by <code>SFC.EXE</code> (System File Checker), can be identified with the following administrator command:</p>
<p class="pre">findstr /C:"[SR] Cannot repair member file" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs. log&gt;sfcdetails.txt</p>
<p class="indent">Use Notepad or the <code>edit</code> command to open the file (normally located in C:\Windows\System32 folder). From an elevated command prompt, the following commands are used to grant administrators access to the protected files, so they can be replaced:</p>
<p class="pre">takeown /f <span class="EmpItalic">filename_including_path</span></p>
<p class="noindent">where <span class="EmpItalic">filename_including_path</span> is the full path and file name to the problem file.</p>
<p class="pre">icacls <span class="EmpItalic">filename_including_path</span>/GRANT ADMINISTRATORS:F</p>
<p class="noindent">Then use the <code>COPY</code> command to replace the file with a known good one.</p>
<p class="pre">copy <span class="EmpItalic">source_filename destination_filename</span></p>
<p class="noindent">where the source and destination are the full path and file.</p>

<p class="noindent">Windows XP, Vista, or 7 can be installed from a central location using a network or locally using discs. The pre-installation of any operating system is more important than the installation. Technicians who grab a disc and load a new operating system without going through a preparation process are asking for trouble. It is important to follow these steps before installing Windows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Decide whether the installation will be an upgrade or a clean install and which version of the operating system is to be loaded. Take into account software application compatibility.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Decide whether the computer will have more than one operating system installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Plan the partition/volume size and select the file system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Determine whether the hardware is compatible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Obtain any drivers, upgrades, or hardware replacements.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Back up any data files.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Scan for viruses, and then disable the virus protection during the installation process.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> Temporarily disable any power management or disk management tools.</p>
<p class="indent">The first decision to make when planning to install an operating system is whether to upgrade from another operating system or to perform a clean install. An <strong><a id="ch12term56" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1034" class="pd_blue">upgrade</a></strong> or in place upgrade is when a computer already has an older operating system on it and a newer operating system is being installed. A <strong><a id="ch12term08" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0143" class="pd_blue">clean install</a></strong> puts an operating system on a computer that does not have one, or removes the existing operating system and installs a new operating system. There are three reasons to perform a clean install:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The computer does not have an operating system already installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The current operating system is not upgradable to the desired Windows version.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The current operating system is upgradable to a specific Windows version, but the existing files and applications are going to be reloaded.</p>
<p class="indent">When you decide to upgrade, you must take into account what operating system is already installed, what hardware is installed, what applications are being used, and whether they are compatible with the new operating system. When Windows is installed as an upgrade, the userâs applications and data are preserved if the operating system is installed in the same folder (directory) as the original operating system. If Windows is installed in a different folder, then all applications must be reloaded.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_581"></a>Windows XP Professional supports upgrading from the following operating systems:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows 98</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows Me</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ NT Workstation 4</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ 2000 Professional</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ XP Home</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that Windows XP Home edition only supports upgrades from Windows 98 and Windows ME.</p>
<p class="indent">Microsoft describes an in-place installation as an installation that requires no movement of files. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab04">Table 12.4</a> shows the Windows XP versions and corresponding Vista versions that can be used for in-place upgrade. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab05">Table 12.5</a> shows the possible Windows 7 upgrades.

<p class="notepara">Be advised that any devices normally used with a computer, especially USB devices, should be connected to the computer before starting Upgrade Advisor.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The Microsoft <strong><a id="ch12term57" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1035" class="pd_blue">Upgrade Advisor</a></strong> application should always be used before upgrading Windows. Upgrade Advisor can be downloaded, installed, and executed to see if a Windows XP, Vista, or 7 computer can function well with a higher version of Windows Vista or 7. Upgrade advisor checks hardware, connected devices, and existing applications, and makes recommendations before an upgrade. It might seem unusual to think you would run it on a Vista- or 7-based computer, but with the different versions of Vista and 7, the Upgrade Advisor is commonly used to see if a more powerful version is an option.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_582"></a>In order to take advantage of Windows reliability, enhancements, and security features, sometimes a clean installation is the best choice. Because a clean installation involves formatting the hard drive, the userâs data must be backed up and all applications re-installed once the Windows installation is complete. Also, all user-defined settings are lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Upgrading from a version of Windows XP to Vista (upgrading XP to 7 is not allowed) and keeping operating system settings and files is not always possible for an in-place upgrade. Even when Microsoft states that it <em>can</em> be done, there is no guarantee that all applications and settings will work after the upgrade. In a corporate environment, if custom software is involved, contact the software developer for any known issues or test the software in a test environment before deploying corporate-wide. The information may be posted on the software developer website. Also, Microsoft has a list of compatible software for many of the popular applications and games on their website.</p>
<p class="indent">The Easy Transfer program or the USMT (User State Migration Tool) can be used to migrate data when replacing XP with Windows 7. Windows Easy Transfer (<code>migwiz.exe</code>) is free from Microsoft to copy files and operating system settings to another drive, to removable media, over a network, or to another storage location. Once the operating system is installed, the files and settings are re-applied to the upgraded computer. This tool can also be used when a computer is being replaced and a data migration is required, such as when Windows 7 is replacing XP.</p>
<p class="indent">IT staff use the <strong><a id="ch12term58" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1047" class="pd_blue">USMT</a></strong> to perform large deployments of Windows. This tool is used from a command line for more control and customized settings, including registry changes.

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If the Program Compatibility Wizard does not work, the Windows XP Mode is an option. <strong><a id="ch12term63" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1089" class="pd_blue">Windows XP Mode</a></strong> is an optional program that can be downloaded and used in Windows Vista and 7 Professional, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions. Once it is downloaded and installed, access the software by clicking on the <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>All Programs</em> &gt; <em>Windows Virtual PC</em> &gt; <em>Virtual Windows XP</em>. Hardware including optical and USB drives are normally accessible through Windows XP Mode, but not all hardware may work in this environment. Also, Windows XP Mode is not suited for graphic-intensive games or applications.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows XP Mode can be customized for a specific Windows version. Right-click the <em>Windows XP mode</em> Start button option and select <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Compatibility</em> tab. A drop-down compatibility mode menu allows the choice of Windows versions starting with Windows 95. Note that an application installed in Windows XP Mode appears in both the Windows XP Mode application list (within the Windows Virtual PC folder) and in the Windows 7 application list.</p>
<p class="indent">Another option is to manually assign a particular application to be compatible with an older (selectable) Windows version. Locate the application in the Start button menu. Right-click the application and select <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Compatibility</em> tab &gt; enable (check) the <em>Run this program in compatibility mode for</em> checkbox &gt; use the drop down menu to select the specific operating system &gt; use the specific video and administrator options available in the <em>Settings</em> and <em>Privilege Level</em> sections &gt; click <em>Apply</em> &gt; click <em>OK</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you have determined whether the software is compatible with Windows, you may have to obtain software patches, upgrades, or buy a new version of the application. This is best done before installing Windows. Be proactive, not reactiveâsolve any problems you can <em>before</em> upgrading or installing any operating system. Such preparation is usually more work than the actual installation process, but any omitted steps will cost you more time in the long run.</p>

<p class="notepara">The retail version of one copy of Windows cannot be installed on two computers at once. However, a retail version of Windows (as opposed to OEM versions) can be uninstalled on one computer and put on a different computer.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The second pre-installation step is to determine whether to install more than one operating system. This situation is often called a dual-boot or multi-boot scenario. Both operating systems are best installed onto separate drive partitions. Otherwise, you could use virtualization to install and use multiple operating systems. Virtualization is covered later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">The third step is to determine how large to make the drive partition (called volumes in Vista/7) and select the file system to be used. One option is to place the operating system in one partition and data in a separate partition to make it easier to back up the data. Drives can be partitioned during the Windows installation process, Otherwise, the entire drive is used.</p>
<p class="indent">During the installation process, when the partition is created, you are asked whether you want to do a full format or a quick format. A <strong><a id="ch12term19" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0398" class="pd_blue">full format</a></strong> identifies and marks bad sectors so they will not be used for data storage. A <strong><a id="ch12term35" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0780" class="pd_blue">quick format</a></strong> skips this analysis. Microsoft recommends doing a quick format if the hard disk has been formatted before and you are sure there are no damaged sectors. A best practice is that if the drive is an older drive, do a full format (but remember this is time intensive); otherwise, do a quick format. A full format would also be done any time you want to ensure that data is erased, such as installing a hard drive that was removed from another computer.</p>
<p class="indent">The file system should be NTFS for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Security (individual files can be protected)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ More efficient use of cluster space</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Supports file compression</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Supports larger hard drive partition sizes</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Includes journaling, which helps to rebuild the file system after a crash or power failure. FAT is non-journalingâit does not track changes made to the file system.</p>
<p class="indent">An issue that is relevant only when upgrading is whether to convert an old FAT16 or FAT32 hard drive partition to NTFS. Once a partition is converted to NTFS, the partition cannot be changed. If you are unsure whether to convert a partition, leave it unchanged and later use the <code>convert</code> command to upgrade (without losing any data).</p>

Remember, once you go to a higher file system, you cannot go back.</p>

<p class="indent">The fourth step when installing Windows is to determine what computer hardware is installed. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab06">Table 12.6</a> lists the minimum and preferred hardware requirements for installing Windows XP Professional. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab07">Table 12.7</a> lists the requirements for most Vista versions. One of the things that might influence your choice of Windows version is the amount of memory supported by the different flavors. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab08">Table 12.8</a> lists those maximums, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab09">Table 12.9</a> shows the requirements to install Windows 7.</p>

<p class="indent">Once hardware has been verified, you have to obtain hardware device drivers specific to the operating system from the hardware manufacturerâs website as the fifth step. The hardware device may have to be upgraded or replaced. Sometimes, older operating system drivers do work, but many times the older drivers do not work or they do not work properly. This is the cost of going to a more powerful operating system. The customer may also decide at this point not to upgrade, but to buy a computer with the desired version of Windows already installed instead.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The Microsoft Upgrade Advisor tool may have recommended getting updated drivers for specific piece of hardware. Drivers related to hard drives are especially critical to the installation process: hardware RAID, motherboard AHCI mode, SATA hard drive (especially when installing or re-installing Windows XP), and hard drives over 2TB. Obtain any of these hard drive-related drivers <em>before</em> the installation or you will not be able to install the operating system to that hard drive.</p>
<p class="indent">The sixth step is one of the most important: In any upgrade, hardware change, or software change, you must back up the user data. Whether you do a clean install or an upgrade, if the user has data on the computer, it must be backed up before starting the installation process. Also, before backing up the data, remove any unwanted files and/or applications that are no longer needed in order to free up hard drive space.</p>

<p class="notepara">Whether doing a clean install or upgrade, disable the antivirus protection until after the installation. If possible, disconnect the computer from the network before disabling the software.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The seventh step in planning for a Windows installation is to scan the system for viruses. Viruses can cause havoc on an upgrade or clean install. The next section provides more information about the most common types of viruses.</p>
<p class="indent">The last step in the pre-installation checklist is to remove any power- or disk-management tools that are loaded. They can interfere with the new tools provided with Windows and can prevent an operating system from installing.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec5"><span class="pd_blue">Viruses</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Before installing a new operating system on a computer that already has an operating system loaded, you should run a virus scan with the latest virus scanning software version. A <strong><a id="ch12term59" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1063" class="pd_blue">virus</a></strong> is a computer program that is designed to do something to your computer that changes the way the computer originally operated. Examples include infecting the computer so it does not boot, infecting a particular application so it does not operate or performs differently, and erasing files. Some viruses are not written to cause harm but simply to cause mischief, such as a program that puts a picture on the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Viruses can cause many unusual and frustrating problems during an operating system installation. Some technicians think that by high-level formatting the hard drive no virus can exist. This is a mistake. Do not take that chance. Take a few moments to scan the hard drive for viruses. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab10">Table 12.10</a> shows common virus types and their descriptions.</p>

<p class="notepara">A technician is responsible for ensuring that any computer deployed has an antivirus application installed and that the application is configured to receive virus signature updates. Educate users about viruses and what to do if a computer gets one.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If a virus is detected or even suspected, run an antivirus program. Note that the computer may have to be booted into Safe Mode, Recovery Console (XP), or WinRE (Vista/7). If the computer can reach the Internet, download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner. If Internet connectivity is too slow or not an option, restart the computer and press the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/f8.jpg" alt="Image" width="26" height="20"></span> key before Windows loads. Access the <em>Safe Mode with Networking</em> and use the Internet to download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner application.</p>
<p class="indent">Antivirus applications can be configured to run in manual mode (on demand) or as scheduled scans. Also quarantine the infected computer(s). This means you should disconnect the computer from the network until the computer is virus free. Some antivirus programs can quarantine a computer automatically if the computer has a virus. Many antivirus software programs have the ability to quarantine filesâfiles that appear to the antivirus program as possible virus-infected or suspicious files that might be dangerous. A message normally appears with a list of files that have been quarantined, and each one must be identified as a valid file or to be left in the quarantine (unusable) until a new version of the antivirus signature files has been updated and can identify the file.</p>
<p class="indent">The time to get an antivirus program is <em>before</em> a virus infects the computer because the damage may be irreversible, especially if backups are not performed. Always back up data files before upgrading to a new operating system. Backups are an important part of any computer support plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Free antivirus applications do exist, including <strong><a id="ch12term27" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0585" class="pd_blue">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></strong>, which is available for download from <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft.com</a>. This product can be used on Windows XP, Vista, and 7, but not Windows 8. Windows 8 has antivirus protection and other security features integrated as part of the operating system.</p>
<p class="indent">An operating system upgrade or installation can be affected by other software. For example, some antivirus software can be set to load into memory when the computer boots and runs continuously. The antivirus software can prevent the upgrade or patch (service pack) from installing. Other types of software that can prevent an operating system from being upgraded are power management and disk management software/tools. Disable these utilities and applications before attempting an operating system installation or upgrade.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Installation/Upgrade of Windows</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">After completing all the pre-installation steps, you are ready to install Windows. The installation process is easy if you performed the pre-installation steps. Hands-on exercises follow that guides you through a clean installation (one where no other operating system is on the machine), an upgrade of XP, an installation of Vista, and an installation of Windows 7. The number-one piece of advice to heed is to do your installation/upgrade research first. The number of possible problems will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">During the Windows XP installation process, the computer must be restarted three times. This has been improved upon by the Windows Vista and 7 installation process. In the XP first phase, a selection must be made whether to upgrade or perform a clean installation, the product key must be entered, and a basic hardware check including available disk space must be accomplished. The computer restarts. After the restart, the second phase begins and setup runs in text mode. During this process, a partition to install Windows can be chosen and setup files are copied to the partition. The computer restarts and the third phase begins. During this portion, devices are installed, the Administrator password is entered, and the operating system is created. The system restarts a final time and the logon screen is presented. Windows Vista and 7 have a similar process in that you can partition the drive, select a preconfigured partition, and select a password.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_588"></a>Part of the installation process is to select the type of network: home, work, or public. Computers on a home network could be a part of a homegroup or workgroup. Computers on a work network can see and share information with other work computers but cannot create or join a homegroup by default. With a public network, a computer attaches to an unsecure network, as in a restaurant or book store. Your computer is not visible to other computers by default when the public network option is chosen. (<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab11">Table 12.11</a> shows these types.) Note that you can bypass the network configuration and configure it later. Networking is covered in more depth in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Corporate computer installations are much more involved than any other type of deployment. Computers are installed in bulk instead of one at a time, as in a home or small business. The computers are frequently the same model and have the same software installed (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig02">Figure 12.2</a>).</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 12.2.</span> Corporate computer deployment</p>
<p class="indent">Disk imaging is common in the corporate environment. Disk imaging software makes an exact copy (a binary copy) of the files loaded on the hard drive. The copy is then pressed to an optical disc, an external drive, or put on a network drive to be copied and deployed onto other computers.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies need automated installation tools to help with this process. Tools that can help with this are Windows XPâs Sysprep tool, imaging software such as Symantec Corporationâs Ghost program, Microsoftâs Setup Manager, Windows SIM (System Image Manager), and MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit). An image can be created and deployed to multiple computers. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab12">Table 12.12</a> describes some of these tools.</p>

<p class="notepara">There is no limit to the number of times a computer can be re-imaged, but there is a limit to how many times a computer can be re-armed or have the Windows activation clock reset. You can use the Sysprep tool to reset the re-arm count. To see how many times the computer has been re-armed, use the <code>slmgr /dlv</code> command.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">When making a Windows 7 image, you have to remove the unique identifiers from the computer before deploying the image to the other computers. This would include a computer name, SID (security identifierâa unique number used in XP), a network domain, etc. You must also reset or re-arm the Windows activation clock if a single activation key is used. Without doing this, you are prompted for the Windows 7 product key as soon as the computer boots. By re-arming the activation clock, you have a 30-day grace period before having to re-enter the product key.</p>
<p class="indent">To get corporate computer images across a network, a variety of methods can be used, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab13">Table 12.13</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">When deploying Windows Vista or 7, licensing is handled a bit differently. Larger businesses buy a VLK (volume license key). Two other choices are MAK or KMS. With <strong><a id="ch12term25" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0554" class="pd_blue">MAK</a></strong> (Multiple Activation Key), the Internet or a phone call must be used to register one or more computers. This method has a limited number of activations, but more licenses can be purchased. The <strong><a id="ch12term23" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0521" class="pd_blue">KMS</a></strong> (Key Management Service) method is used in companies with 25 or more computers to deploy. Technical support staff can also use a deployment tool that allows automating product key entry and customizing disc installation images so the computer users are not prompted for a key the first time they use a software package. KMS is a software application installed on a computer. All newly installed Vista- or 7-based computers register with the computer that has KMS installed. Every 180 days, the computers are re-activated for the Windows license. Each KMS key can be used on two computers up to 10 times.</p>
<p class="indent">Any existing data can be backed up to another hard drive, a network drive, or pressed to one or more optical discs. Remember to restore the data once the upgrade has been completed or the new computer installed.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec8"><span class="pd_blue">Verifying the Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In any upgrade or installation, verification that the upgrade is successful is critical in both home and business environments. After an upgrade has been done, verify that all applications still function. After a new installation has been completed, ensure that all installed hardware is detected by Device Manager.</p>

<h3 id="ch12lev1sec9"><a id="page_591"></a><span class="pd_blue">Troubleshooting a Windows Installation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Installation problems can be caused by a number of factors. The following list shows the most common causes of problems and their solutions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Incompatible BIOSâObtain compatible BIOS, replace the motherboard with one that has compatible BIOS, or do not upgrade or install the higher Windows version.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ BIOS needs to be upgradedâUpgrade (flash) the BIOS.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Incompatible hardware driversâObtain the appropriate Windows version drivers from the hardware manufacturer (not Microsoft).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Incompatible applicationsâObtain upgrades from the software manufacturer, use Windows XP Mode, use the Program Compatibility Wizard, use a dual-boot environment, use virtualization (covered later in this chapter).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Minimum hardware requirements have not been metâUpgrade the hardware. The most likely things to check are the CPU and RAM.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A virus is presentâRun an antivirus program and remove the virus.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Antivirus software is installed and active. It is halting the installation/upgradeâDisable through BIOS and/or through the application. Restart the Windows installation and re-enable once the operating system installation is complete.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Pre-installation steps have not been completedâGo back through the list.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The installation disc is corrupted (not as likely as the other causes)âTry the disc in another machine and see if you can see the contents. Check if a scratch or dirt is on the disc surface. Clean the disc as necessary.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Incorrect registration keyâType in the correct key to complete the installation. The key is located on the disc, disc case, or in an email.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the Windows XP installation cannot find a hard drive, it is most likely due to a SATA drive being used and a driver is not available for the controller. Download the driver, put on a floppy/flash drive or use a software program such as nLite to create a custom XP installation CD that includes the downloaded driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A STOP message occurs when installing a dual-boot systemâBoot from the Windows XP, Vista, or 7 installation disc rather than the other operating system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The computer locks up during setup and shows a <strong><a id="ch12term07" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0101" class="pd_blue">BSOD</a></strong> (blue screen of death)âCheck the BIOS and hardware compatibility. Also, if an error message appears, research the error on the Internet.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A message appears during setup that a device driver was unable to loadâObtain the latest device drivers that are compatible and restart the setup program.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ After upgrading to Windows 7, the computer freezes. Boot to Safe Mode and check Device Manager for errors. If no errors are present, disable the following devices if present: video adapter, sound card, network card, USB devices and controller (unless keyboard/mouse is USB), optical drive, modem, unused ports. Enable each disabled device one at a time until the blue screen appears. Once the problem device is known, obtain the appropriate replacement driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The Windows 7 0xC004F061 activation error is caused by a product key being used for an upgrade Windows 7 version and a previous Windows version was not on the computer when the installation was performed. If the drive was formatted <em>before</em> starting the installation, the upgrade product key cannot be used. Install 7 with the current Windows running or if you want to format the hard drive and an upgrade version is being used, do so through the Windows 7 installation process: boot with upgrade DVD, click <em>Custom (advanced)</em>, and select <em>Drive options (advanced)</em>.</p>

<h3 id="ch12lev1sec11"><span class="pd_blue">Virtualization</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As introduced in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, PC or client virtualization is the process of running multiple operating systems on a single host machine. PC virtualization allows older software to be executed in a protected environment, new software to be tested in an environment that wonât affect the normal operating system, and two operating systems (or more) to be installed that cannot see or interfere with one another (refer to <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig13">Figures 2.13</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch11.html#ch11fig21">11.21</a>).</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ External networkâThe external network option allows a particular VM access to a different (external) network from within the VM. In a college environment, for example, if the student computer can access the Internet and that same computer is configured for virtualization, a VM on that student computer can be configured for the external network and have access to the Internet.</p>

<p class="noindent">The registry is a database that contains information about the Windows environment including installed hardware, installed software, and users. The registry should be backed up whenever the computer is fully functional and when any software or hardware changes are made.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Back up the registry</span></p>
<p class="notepara">The registry should be backed up and restored on a working computer <em>before</em> disaster hits. The time to learn how to restore the registry is not when the computer is down.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The registry can be backed up and restored several different ways:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Using the <code>regedit</code> program</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Using the Backup utility</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Using the System Restore tool (covered later in this chapter)</p>
<p class="indent">The <code>regedit</code> program allows you to export the registry to a file that has the extension <code>.reg</code>. The file can be imported back into the computer if the computer fails. The <code>regedit</code> program and the Backup utility both back up the entire registry.</p>
<p class="indent">The Backup utility in XP is accessed through <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>All Programs</em> &gt; <em>Accessories</em> &gt; <em>System Tools</em> &gt; <em>Backup</em>. In Windows 7 from the <em>Start</em> menu &gt; <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>System and Security</em> &gt; <em>Backup and Restore</em>. The Backup utility is the preferred method for backing up the Windows registry, but in Vista/7 the full version of the Backup tool (the part that can back up the registry) is only available in Windows Vista/7 Business, Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate versions. (See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig05">Figure 12.5</a>.) The backup option to look for specifically in Windows XP is the System State, which is discussed in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="ch12lev1sec15"><span class="pd_blue">Backing Up and Restoring the Windows System State</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One option available in the Windows XP Backup utility is the System State. The System State is a group of important Windows XP files including the registry, the system files, the boot files, and the COM+ Class Registration database. With the Backup utility, you cannot back up or restore these items individually. They are all needed because they depend on one another to operate properly. The registry files are located in a folder normally labeled <em>%systemroot%</em>\Repair\Regbackup (which is normally C:\Winnt\Repair\Backup or C:\Windows\Repair\Backup, depending on the type of installation). The registry can be restored without having to restore the other System State files.</p>

<p class="notepara">In order to use the Backup program, you must be an administrator (XP, Vista, or 7) or in XP, a member of the Backup Operators group.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">In order to correct a problem with the system files, registry, or Windows XP boot failure, you must restore the registry. You may also have to restore the System State files (which includes the registry) to make the system operational again. To start the restoration process, install Windows XP to the same folder that it was installed in originally. When you are prompted to format the hard drive volume or leave it, select the <em>Leave the current file system intact</em> option. Use the Backup utility to restore the System State and/or the registry. Click the <em>Restore</em> tab and select the device that holds the backed-up files.</p>
<p class="indent">The Windows Vista and 7 Backup and Restore link can also be used to back up the system state (even though that option is not shown like it is in XP). This link can also be used to back up files and an entire disk image. To access this link, click on the <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>System and Maintenance</em> (Vista)/<em>System and Security</em> (7) &gt; <em>Backup and Restore</em> &gt; <em>Create a system repair disc</em>.

<h3 id="ch12lev1sec16"><a id="page_599"></a><span class="pd_blue">Configuring Windows Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the most common windows used by technicians is the <em>Control Panel</em> window. A control panel is a method for configuring various components. Each control panel icon represents a Windows utility that allows you to customize a particular part of the Windows environment. The number of control panels displayed depends on the type of computer and the components contained within the computer. Windows has two control panel viewsâ<em>Classic</em> and <em>Category</em>. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig06">Figure 12.6</a> shows the Windows 7 control panels, in Category view.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 12.6.</span> Windows 7 Control Panel categories</p>
<p class="indent">Technicians must know which control panel category to use for changing a computerâs configuration. Review the control panels from <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>. Windows XP, Vista, and 7 have some configuration options that are unique to that particular operating systems. A technician should be familiar with these differences. More labs at the end of this chapter help familiarize you with several control panel categories. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab18">Table 12.18</a> shows the unique control panels by operating system.</p>

<p class="indent">Note that the RemoteApp and Desktop Connections Control Panel link is used to access a computer such as a workplace computer from a remote place. The configuration requires a URL from the network administrator to make this connection.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec17"><a id="page_600"></a><span class="pd_blue">Configuring Windows</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Technicians must frequently add new hardware and software using the operating system. Windows has specific tools for these functions. Using the correct procedure is essential for success. The following sections highlight many of the tasks a technician must perform:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Adding devices</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Removing hardware components</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Adding a printer</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Installing/removing software</p>
<p class="indent">Hardware devices are physical components that connect to the computer. A <strong><a id="ch12term14" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0226" class="pd_blue">device driver</a></strong> is a piece of software that allows hardware to work with a specific operating system. Device drivers are operating system dependent. A printer driver that works with Windows XP may not work with Windows 7. Not all manufacturers provide updates for the newer operating systems. Also, some device drivers are automatically included with Windows and are updated continuously through Windows updates. A technician must be aware of what hardware is installed into a system so that the latest compatible drivers can be downloaded and installed.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec18"><span class="pd_blue">Adding Devices</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Plug and play devices are hardware and software designed to automatically be recognized by the operating system. These devices include USB devices; IEEE 1394 devices; SCSI devices; PC Card and ExpressCard devices; PCI/PCIe devices; and printers. eSATAp, USB, IEEE 1394, PC Card devices, and ExpressCard devices can be added or removed with power applied. Adapters are installed and removed with the computer powered off and the power cord removed. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig07">Figure 12.7</a>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 12.7.</span> Adding hardware to a Windows PC</p>
<p class="indent">The keys to a successful device installation are as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Possessing the most up-to-date device driver for the specific installed operating system</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Following the directions provided by the device manufacturer</p>
<p class="indent">Once a device is installed, power on the computer. The Windows <em>Found New Hardware</em> Wizard appears. Windows XP attempts to find a driver for the new device. Plug and play devices make use of a special <code>.CAB</code> (cabinet) file called <code>driver.cab</code> located in <em>%winroot%</em>\Driver Cache\i386 folder (where <em>%winroot%</em> is normally <code>C:\Winnt</code> or <code>C:\Windows</code>). If Windows XP detects <a id="page_601"></a>new hardware, it will automatically search <code>driver.cab</code> for a driver. If a driver cannot be found, a dialog box appears. The best policy with any operating system is to use the latest driver even if the operating system detects the device. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12a.html#ch12lev2sec16">Labs 12.16</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12a.html#ch12lev2sec17">12.17</a> outline how to install a new hardware driver.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 do not use the <code>driver.cab</code> system. Instead, they use driver packages that are stored in an indexed database. The drivers are stored in the <em>Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository</em> folder. All driver files that are not part of the operating system must be imported into this folder before the driver package can be installed. Drivers created for earlier Windows versions may need to be updated.</p>
<p class="indent">Some Windows device drivers use digital signatures, which is sometimes called driver signing or a signed driver. The digital signature confirms that the device driver for a particular piece of hardware has met certain criteria for WHQL (Windows hardware quality lab) tests and is compatible with Windows. Digital signatures are required for 64-bit kernel mode drivers in Windows Vista and 7. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig08">Figure 12.8</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="indent">Windows XP has a control panel called <em>Add Hardware</em> or, if using control panel categories, the <em>Printers and Other Hardware</em> category &gt; <em>Add Hardware</em>. The <em>Add Hardware</em> Wizard helps you configure hardware that Windows XP does not automatically recognize. It is also used for plug and play devices that donât install properly with Windows XPâs automatic detection. You must have Administrator privileges in order to load device drivers for new hardware.</p>

<p class="indent">If an <code>.inf</code> file cannot be found in a folder from your driver download, look in subfolders or other folders that might hold the file. You could always download the driver again and pay attention to the folder name in which the driver is stored. If there are multiple <code>.inf</code> files in the folder, you may have to try them one at a time until you find the one that works with your hardware. Always reboot Windows after a driver installation, even if the system does not prompt for a reboot.</p>

<p class="notepara">Windows updates include device driver updates. If the computer fails to boot after a Windows update, reboot the computer to WinRE Safe Mode and use the System Restore tool to restore the registry to an earlier time so the problem can be researched. If multiple updates were installed, try loading the updates one at a time.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Restore points are created weekly and whenever a system update occurs in Windows Vista/7. However, you can do a restore point at any time especially before doing an important upgrade or installation. A particular amount of disk space is used for restore points. When new restore points are created, the older ones are removed automatically. System Restore is your number-one tool for solving problems within the operating system and registry.</p>
<p class="indent">System Restore can also be used if you suspect that the registry is corrupt. For example, if an application that worked fine yesterday, but today displays a message that the application cannot be found, you may have a virus, a corrupt application executable file, or a corrupt registry. Run an antivirus check first with updated virus definitions. If free of viruses, use the System Restore utility to roll back the system to yesterday or the day before this problem occurred. Sometimes System Restore works best if executed from Safe Mode (covered later in this chapter). If System Restore does not fix the problem, re-install the application.</p>
<p class="indent">System Restore requires a file system of NTFS. Windows Vista and 7 use a different type of System Restore technology than Windows XP used; Vista and 7 use <strong><a id="ch12term44" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0887" class="pd_blue">Shadow Copy</a></strong> technology, which uses a block-level image instead of monitoring certain files for file changes. Backup media can be optical discs, flash devices, other hard drives, and server storage, but not tape. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig10">Figure 12.10</a> shows how you can select a specific date during the System Restore process.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_607"></a>The three major tool categories found in the Computer Management console are <em>System Tools</em>, <em>Storage</em>, and <em>Services and Applications</em>. The System Tools include Task Scheduler (Vista/7), Event Viewer, Shared Folders, Local Users and Groups, Device Manager, Performance (7), Reliability and Performance (Vista),and Performance Logs and Alerts (XP).</p>
<p class="indent">The Shared Folders tool is used to view shares, sessions, and open files. Shares can be folders that have been shared on the computer, printers, or a network resource such as a scanner. Sessions list network users who are currently connected to the computer as well as the network usersâ computer names, the network connection type (Windows, NetWare, or Macintosh), how many resources have been opened by the network user, how long the user has been connected, and whether or not this user is connected using the Guest user account. Open files are files that are currently opened by network users. In order to use the Shared Folders tool, you must be a member of the Administrators or Power Users group (XP only).</p>
<p class="indent">In the left Computer Management window pane, expand the <em>Shared Folders</em> option and click the <em>Shares</em> option. The network shares appear in the right pane. Double-click any of the shares to view the Properties window. From this window, using the <em>Share Permissions</em> or <em>Security</em> tabs, permissions can be set for shared resources.

<p class="indent">The Local Users and Groups tool is used to create and manage accounts for those who use the computer or computer resources from a remote network computer. These accounts are considered local users or local groups and are managed from the computer being worked on. In contrast, domain or global users and groups are administered by a network administrator on a network server. Permissions are granted or denied to files, folders, and network resources such as a shared printer or scanner. Rights can also be assigned. Rights are computer actions such as performing a backup or shutting down the computer.

(In Windows XP, it is a red X.) This means the account has been disabled. In Vista or 7, double-click the <em>Guest</em> icon. Look at the <em>Account is disabled</em> checkbox to see if the account is disabled. The box is checked by default, meaning that the Guest account is not available for use. In XP, Vista, and 7, to create a new user, click the <em>Action</em> menu option and select <em>New User</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 have two types of user accounts: Standard user and Administrator. The Administrator account has full control over the system, as it always has in Windows. By default, the Standard user cannot install most applications or change system settings. All users on the computer should have a Standard user account that is used for everyday use. Any account designated as an Administrator account should be used only to log onto the system to make system changes and install new software. These two accounts are affected by a new feature in Windows Vista/7 called UAC (User Access Control). UAC works in conjunction with Internet Explorer 7 and higher, Windows Defender, and Parental Controls to provide a heightened awareness to security issues. A UAC message appears anytime something occurs that normally would require an administrator-level decision to make changes to the system. An application that has a security shield icon overlay is going to display a UAC prompt when executed. If a Standard user is logged in, a message appears stating that the task is prohibited or that Administrator credentials must be provided (and the Administrator password entered to proceed). This is to protect users from themselves as well as software that is trying to change the system. Even if a person is logged in with an Administrator account, the UAC prompt appears to confirm the action that is about to be performed.</p>

<p class="notepara">Whenever the <em>Last Known Good Configurati</em>on option is used, all configuration changes made since the last successful boot are lost. However, since the changes are the most likely cause of Windows not booting correctly, Last Known Good Configuration is a useful tool when installing new devices and drivers that do not work properly.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If Last Known Good Configuration does not work properly, boot the computer into Safe Mode, which is covered in the next section. If Windows works, but a hardware device does not work and a new driver has been recently loaded, use the <em>driver roll back</em> option for the device.</p>
<p class="indent">Safe Mode is used when the computer stalls, slows down, or does not work right, or problems are caused by improper video, intermittent errors, or new hardware/software installation. Safe Mode is used to start Windows with minimum device drivers and services. Software that automatically loads during startup is disabled in Safe Mode and user profiles are not loaded.</p>

<p class="notepara">When the computer boots in Safe Mode, the mouse, keyboard, CD/DVD, and 640Ã480 default video device drivers are the only items loaded.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Safe Mode allows you to access configuration files and make necessary changes, troubleshoot installed software and hardware, disable software and services, and adjust hardware and software settings that may be causing Windows to not start correctly. The bottom line is that Safe Mode puts the computer in a âbarebonesâ mode so you can troubleshoot problems.</p>

<p class="noindent">Windows can be booted using a variety of methods as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab22">Table 12.22</a>. Some of these methods may require additional BIOS configuration especially the order in which the computer looks to devices for an operating system (boot order). Some of these options may not be supported.</p>

<p class="indent">With Windows there are two types of partitions that are important during the boot processâthe system partition/volume and the boot partition/volume. The <strong><a id="ch12term48" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0968" class="pd_blue">system partition</a></strong> (XP and lower) or <strong><a id="ch12term50" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0972" class="pd_blue">system volume</a></strong> (Vista and higher) is the active drive partition that has the files needed to load the operating system. The system partition is normally the <code>C:</code> drive (the active partition). The <strong><a id="ch12term05" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0090" class="pd_blue">boot partition</a></strong> (XP and lower) or <strong><a id="ch12term06" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0093" class="pd_blue">boot volume</a></strong> (Vista and higher) is the partition or logical drive where the operating system files are located. One thing that people sometimes forget is that the system partition and the boot partition can be on the same partition. These partitions are where certain boot files are located.</p>
<p class="indent">Every operating system needs specific files that allow the computer to boot. These files are known as <strong><a id="ch12term46" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0965" class="pd_blue">system files</a></strong> or startup files. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12tab23">Table 12.23</a> shows the system files and their specific location on the hard drive.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/12tab23.jpg" alt="Image" width="916" height="617"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_613"></a>Reading about Windows files can be confusing because the file locations frequently have the entries %<em>systemroot</em>% and %<em>systemdrive</em>%. This is because computers can be partitioned differently. If you install Windows onto a drive letter (a partition or logical drive) other than the active partition (normally <code>C:</code>), the startup files can be on two different drive letters. Also, you do not have to take the default folder name of <em>Winnt</em> or <em>Windows</em> (depending on the type of installation) to install Windows. To account for these different scenarios, Microsoft uses the %<em>systemroot</em>% to represent the boot partition, the partition and folder that contains the majority of the Windows files. %<em>systemdrive</em>% represents the root directory. On a computer with a single operating system, this would be <code>C:\</code>.</p>

<p class="notepara">If Windows XP is installed onto the <code>C:</code> drive and the <code>C:</code> drive is the active partition, then the <code>boot.ini</code>, <code>bootsect.dos</code>, <code>hyperfil.sys</code>, <code>ntbootdd.sys</code>, <code>ntdetect.com</code>, and <code>ntldr</code> files would all be in the root directory of <code>C:</code>. The <code>hal.dll</code> and <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> files would be located in the <em>System32</em> folder (located in either the <em>Winnt</em> or <em>Windows</em> folder) on the <code>C:</code> drive.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The boot process for any Windows version is actually quite involved, but the major steps for Windows XP are as follows:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Power on the computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> POST executes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> BIOS searches BIOS saved configuration for the boot device order and checks for a boot sector. If the boot device is a hard drive, BIOS reads the Master Boot Record, and locates and loads the information into sector 0 of the system partition. The contents of sector 0 define the type of file system, the location of the bootstrap loader file, and start the bootstrap loader. With Windows XP, this file is <code>ntldr</code>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> <code>ntldr</code> starts in real mode so that old software can be loaded. Then XP is switched to 32-bit mode and the file system begins to load.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> <code>ntldr</code> reads the <code>boot.ini</code> file and displays the various operating system choices contained within the <code>boot.ini</code> file. If something other than Windows XP is chosen, the <code>bootsect.dos</code> file takes over. If Windows XP is chosen, the <code>ntdetect.com</code> file executes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> <code>ntdetect.com</code> detects the computerâs hardware and ACPI tables are read so that XP can detect power management features.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> <code>ntldr</code> passes the hardware information to the <code>Ntoskrnl.exe</code> file.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> The operating system kernel, <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code>, executes and the <code>hal.dll</code> file loads. <strong><a id="ch12term20" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0420" class="pd_blue">HAL</a></strong> (hardware abstraction layer) is a layer between the operating system and the hardware devices. The HAL allows Windows XP to run with different hardware configurations and components without affecting (or crashing) the operating system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>9.</strong> The Hkey_Local_Machine\System registry key loads. This registry key is located in the %<em>systemroot</em>%\System32\Config\System file. This key has information found during the hardware detection process and is used to determine which device drivers to load.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>10.</strong> The operating system kernel initializes and <code>NTLDR</code> passes control to it. The Starting Up process bar displays. During this time, a hardware key is created, device drivers load, and services start.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>11.</strong> The <code>winlogon.exe</code> file executes and the logon screen appears. While the logon process is occurring, XP detects plug and play devices.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Installing Vista/7 with older operating systems</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Be careful installing Vista or 7 with an older operating system. Windows Vista or 7 overwrites the MBR, boot sector, and boot files. That is why very few Windows versions are upgradable to Vista or 7.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The Windows Vista/7 boot process has changed to the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Power on the computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> POST executes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_614"></a><strong>3.</strong> BIOS searches the BIOS saved configuration for the boot device order and checks for a boot sector. If the boot device is a hard drive, BIOS reads the MBR and locates and loads the information into sector 0 of the system partition. The contents of sector 0 define the type of file system and the location of the bootstrap loader file and start the bootstrap loader. With Windows Vista/7, this file is <code>bootmgr.exe</code>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> The Windows Boot Manager (<code>bootmgr.exe</code>) reads boot configuration data from the BCD (Boot Configuration Data) database file. Boot Manager replaces the older <code>boot.ini</code> file, can be edited with <code>bcdedit.exe</code>, and allows better support for non-Windows operating systems to coexist with Vista/7. On multi-boot systems, a menu appears. Note that Boot Manager can be accessed by pressing the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/spacebar.jpg" alt="Image" width="74" height="20"></span> during startup.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> If Vista/7 is chosen or the only choice, <code>winload.exe</code> takes control as the operating system boot loader. This file takes the place of <code>ntldr</code> and is responsible for loading the operating system kernel (<code>ntoskrnl.exe</code>) and device drivers.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that if a UEFI/EFI BIOS is installed, the boot order could be modified. UEFI supports a fast boot and booting from a pre-operating system environment that could include Internet connectivity and access to applications such as an antivirus application.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec24"><span class="pd_blue">Speeding Up the Windows Boot Process</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The following tips can help reduce the time Windows takes to become operational:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Configure BIOS boot options so that the drive used to boot Windows is listed as the first option.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Configure BIOS for the fast boot option or disable hardware checks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If multiple operating systems are installed, use the <code>msconfig</code> utility <em>Boot</em> tab to reduce the boot menu timeout value.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove unnecessary startup applications using the <code>msconfig</code> utility.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have available hard disk space and keep the drive defragmented. Note that Vista and 7 are automatically configured to defragment the hard drive at 1:00 a.m. on Wednesday. If the computer is powered off, defragmentation occurs when the computer next boots.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disable unused or unnecessary hardware using Device Manager.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use Windows <strong><a id="ch12term36" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0801" class="pd_blue">ReadyBoost</a></strong> to cache some startup files to a 256MB+ flash drive, SD card, or CF card. Right-click the device to access the <em>Properties</em> option and select the <em>ReadyBoost</em> tab. Note that ReadyBoost does not increase performance on a system that boots from a SSD, so Windows 7 (not Vista) disables ReadyBoost as an option when an SSD is in use.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ In Windows 7, use the <em>System and Security</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Administrative Tools</em> &gt; <em>Services</em>. In XP, use <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>Administrative Tools</em> &gt; <em>Services</em>. Change services that are not needed the moment Windows boots to use the <em>Automatic (Delayed Start)</em> option instead of Automatic.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec25"><span class="pd_blue">Troubleshooting the Windows Boot Process</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Troubleshooting the boot process is sometimes easier to troubleshoot than other type of problems that can occur within the operating system. If the computer locks, has a BSOD, or will not start, try the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove the power cord, re-insert the power cord and power the computer on again. Make note of any beeps or error codes. Use these to troubleshoot.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Determine the last thing that was done before the computer refused to boot. Boot the computer to Safe Mode. Use the System Restore utility to bring the computer back to a date before the issue occurred.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_615"></a>â¢ Boot to Safe Mode and run the SFC (System File Checker) to replace missing or corrupt operating system files or load an appropriate graphics driver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the Last Known Good Configuration option from the Advanced Boot Options menu.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For information on recovering the Windows OS, see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Quite a few things can cause Windows to not boot properly. For example, a non-bootable disk inserted into the floppy drive or media inserted into an optical drive can cause Windows not to boot. If none of the hard drives contain an active partition or if the hard driveâs boot sector information is missing or corrupt (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>), any of the following messages or events could appear:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âInvalid partition tableâ</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âError loading operating systemâ</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âMissing operating systemâ</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ â<code>Boot:</code> Couldnât find <code>NTLDR</code>â (XP)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ â<code>NTLDR</code> is missingâ (Windows XP)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ â<code>BOOTMGR</code> is missingâ (Windows Vista and higher)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âWindows has blocked some startup programsâ</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âThe Windows boot configuration data file is missing required informationâ (Windows Vista and higher)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ âWindows could not start because the following file is missing or corruptâ</p>
<p class="noindent">Also note that if you receive a message that you have an invalid boot disk, a disk read error, or an inaccessible boot device, troubleshoot your hard drive and/or BIOS settings.</p>

<p class="notepara">To disable startup programs, hold down the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/shift.jpg" alt="Image" width="39" height="20"></span> key during the logon process and keep it held down until the desktop icons appear.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If the computer shows âInvalid boot disk,â ensure that the BIOS boot order settings are correct, no virus is installed, and that the first boot device has a valid operating system installed or on disc. Depending on the installed OS, you can also use the <code>fdisk /mbr</code>, <code>bootrec /fixmbr</code>, <code>bootrec /fixboot</code>. Use other <code>bootrec</code> command options if multiple operating systems are installed.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows has a wealth of tools and start modes that can be used to troubleshoot the system. If Windows boots, but still has a problem, try to solve the problem without booting into one of these special modes. For example, if one piece of hardware is not working properly and the system boots properly, use Device Manager and the troubleshooting wizards to troubleshoot the problem. Another problem can be caused by an application that loads during startup.</p>
<p class="indent">For a permanent change to an application starting automatically, move or delete the startup shortcuts from the one of the following places:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ %<em>systemdrive</em>%\Documents and Settings\Username\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ %<em>systemdrive</em>%\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</p>

<p class="indent">If a startup problem appears to occur before the âStarting Windowsâ logo appears, the causes are typically missing startup files, corrupt files, or hardware problems. The Windows Vista and 7 <code>bootsect /nt60 all</code> (or a drive letter instead of <code>all</code> if multiple operating systems are installed) can be used to manually repair the boot sector. The <code>bootsect.exe</code> file is available from the <em>Boot</em> folder of the Windows Vista/7 DVD and can be executed from within Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) covered later in this chapter or from within Windows. If the <a id="page_616"></a>Windows logo appears, but there is a problem before the logon prompt appears, the problem is usually with misconfigured drivers and/or services. If problems occur after the logon window appears, then (1) look to startup applications (hold down the <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/shift.jpg" alt="Image" width="39" height="20"></span> key during startup) or (2) see if the <code>userinit.exe</code> file has issues. Use the <em>Advanced Boot Options</em> startup menu (press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/f8.jpg" alt="Image" width="26" height="20"></span> during startup), and from a command prompt, use the <code>sfc /scannow</code> command to fix the userinit file.</p>

When <em>Selective startup</em> is chosen, you can pick which startup options load. Using the divide-and-conquer method of troubleshooting, find the startup file that is causing boot problems. Start with the first checkbox, <em>Load system services</em>, and deselect the checkbox &gt; <em>OK</em> and restart the computer. When you determine which file is causing the problem (the problem reappears), click the System Configuration tab that corresponds to the problem file and deselect files until the exact problem file is located.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Boot</em> tab allows you to control and modify the Windows boot environment similarly to the BOOT.INI tab in XP. The <em>Boot</em> tab functions include selecting the default operating system and the time allotted to wait for the default operating system to load if no other operating system is chosen from the boot menu in a multiple operating system situation. Advanced options on this tab include defining the number of processors and maximum memory as well as whether <em>PCI Lock and Detect HAL</em> are enabled.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Services</em> and <em>Startup</em> tabs in the System Configuration window are also quite useful when troubleshooting boot problems. Certain applications, such as an antivirus program or the printer, run as services. Many of these services are started during the boot process. The <em>Services</em> tab can be used to disable and enable these boot services. Enable the <em>Hide all Microsoft Services</em> option to view and manipulate third-party (non-Microsoft) services. The <em>Startup</em> tab allows you to enable and disable Windows-based startup programs. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig19">Figure 12.19</a> shows a sample Startup tab screen.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Access Event Viewer in Windows XP by clicking the <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>Performance and Maintenance</em> &gt; <em>Administrative Tools</em> &gt; <em>Event Viewer</em>. In Vista, select the <em>System and Maintenance</em> Control Panel or in Windows 7, select the <em>System and Security</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Administrative Tools</em> &gt; <em>Event Viewer</em>. The left window contains the Event Viewer logs. In Windows XP, these include the application log, the security log, and the system log. The application log displays events associated with a specific program. The programmers who design software decide which events to display in the Event Viewerâs application log. The security log displays events such as when different users log in to the computer (both valid and invalid logins). A technician can pick which events are displayed in the security log. All users can view the system log and the application log, but only a member of Administrators can enable security log information.</p>
<p class="indent">The most commonly used log is the system log. The system log displays events that deal with various system components such as a driver or service that loads during startup. The type of system log events cannot be changed or deleted. Click the system log option in the left panel. The system log events displays in the right window. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig21">Figure 12.21</a> shows an example of Windows XP Event Viewer system log.</p>

Windows Vista/7 Event Viewer has two types of logs: Windows logs and Applications and Services logs (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig22">Figure 12.22</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Some Windows services start automatically each time the computer boots. If one of these services has a problem, there is normally an error message that appears during the boot sequence. You can use the System Configuration utility (<code>msconfig</code>) previously discussed to enable and disable startup services. You can also use Event Viewer to see if the service loaded properly. Another program that you can use is the Services snap-in used from the Computer Management tool. Or, from a command prompt type <span class="EmpStrong"><a id="ch12term43" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0876" class="pd_blue">services.msc</a></span>, and press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/enter.jpg" alt="Image" width="45" height="20"></span>. The <em>Services</em> tool allows you to view what services have been started and stopped and, if desired, allows you to stop a service. Open the Services snap-in and double-click any service.</p>
<p class="indent">The Service window opens and on the General tab are the <em>Stop</em> and <em>Start</em> buttons that can be used to control the service. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig24">Figure 12.24</a> shows the iPod service.

<h3 id="ch12lev1sec31"><span class="pd_blue">Windows Reboots</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the hardest problems to solve is an intermittent problem and when Windows reboots spontaneously or shuts down spontaneously, a lot of different things could be the issue. Spontaneous reboots could be caused by a newly installed Windows update, a newly installed application, or a newly updated driver. A corrupt device driver could also be the culprit, but that is a hard one to find. An Internet search on your specific hardware devices might speed up the troubleshooting process. A spontaneous reboot can also be caused by a virus or malware. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a> for more on those security issues. Other hardware issues could be RAM, processor, video card, and hard drive. You can quickly see why spontaneous reboots would be one of the hardest ones to narrow the field.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_624"></a>A spontaneous reboot however, is different from a spontaneous shut down. A spontaneous shut down tends to be a heat related problem. Check CPU and case fans. Some BIOS menus have options that display internal temperatures. Start taking readings on that. A failing CPU, overloaded power supply, or failing power supply could also cause a spontaneous shut down.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec32"><span class="pd_blue">Shutdown Problems</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Windows should be shut down properly when all work is finished. Before Windows can shut down, the operating system sends a message to all devices, services, and applications. Each device or system service that is running sends a message back saying it is okay to shut down now. Any active application saves data that has not been previously saved and sends a message back to the operating system that it is okay to shut down.</p>
<p class="indent">If the system has trouble shutting down, it is due to devices, services, or applications. The most common problem is an application that does not respond. When this happens, press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/ctrl_alt_del.jpg" alt="Image" width="143" height="20"></span> to access Task Manager. Manually stop any applications that show a status of not responding. You can also click any other applications and stop them to see if they are causing the problem. Sometimes a program will not show a status of not responding until you try to manually stop the application from within Task Manager. If a single application continually prevents Windows from shutting down, contact the software manufacturer to see if there is a fix or check online.</p>
<p class="indent">For services problems, boot the computer into Safe Mode and then shut down the computer. Notice whether or not the computer had any problems shutting down. If the process works, use the System Configuration window <em>General</em> tab <em>Selective startup</em> radio button in conjunction with the <em>Services</em> tab to selectively disable services. Because there are so many services loaded, you might try the divide and conquer methodâdisable half of the services to narrow the list.</p>
<div class="note"><hr>
<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Try the restart option instead of the shutdown option</span></p>
<p class="notepara">If you cannot stop the problem application or determine whether the problem is a service or hardware, try restarting the computer instead of shutting down. Once the computer restarts, try shutting down again. As a last resort, use the computer power button to power the computer off.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">A device does not cause a shutdown problem frequently, so eliminate services and applications first. Then, while working on the computer, notice what devices you are using. Common devices are video, hard drive, optical drive, keyboard, and mouse. Boot to the Advanced Boot Options menu by pressing <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/f8.jpg" alt="Image" width="26" height="20"></span> during booting. Select <em>Enable Boot Logging</em>. Once the system boots, locate the <code>ntbtlog.txt</code> file in the <em>Windows</em> folder. You may have to set folder options within Windows Explorer to list the file and access it. Verify that all your devices have the most up-to-date drivers loaded and that the drivers are compatible with the installed version of Windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, USB or IEEE 1394 FireWire ports can stop a computer from shutting down or powering off. Check the event logs to see if any device did not enter a suspend state. A feature called USB selective suspend allows the Windows hub driver to suspend a particular USB port and not affect the other USB ports. This is particularly important to laptops, netbooks, and ultrabooks because of power consumption. Suspending USB devices when the device is not in use conserves power. If this is causing the problem, this default behavior can be modified using the <em>Power options</em> Control Panel link and accessing the <em>Advanced power settings</em>.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec33"><span class="pd_blue">Monitoring System Performance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is important for a technician to understand how a computer is performing and to be able to analyze why a computer might be running slow. In order to do that, a technician must know what applications are being run on the computer and their effects on the computer resources. A technician must also be able to monitor the computerâs resource usage when problems occur, change the configuration as needed, and observe the results of the configuration change.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_625"></a>Utilities commonly used to monitor system performance include Task Manager, Windows XPâs System Monitor and Performance Logs and Alerts, and Windows Vista/7âs Reliability Monitor and Performance Monitor. Task Manager is used to monitor your current systemâs performance. <strong><a id="ch12term47" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0967" class="pd_blue">System Monitor</a></strong> is used to monitor real-time data about specific computer components. <strong><a id="ch12term32" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0704" class="pd_blue">Performance Logs and Alerts</a></strong> allows creating logs about the computer performance and creating alerts that notify you when a specific instance being monitored reaches a defined threshold. It includes a summary graph of processor and memory usage.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows Vista/7 <strong><a id="ch12term37" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0813" class="pd_blue">Reliability Monitor</a></strong> provides a visual graph of system stability and details on events that might have affected the computerâs reliability. <strong><a id="ch12term33" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0705" class="pd_blue">Performance Monitor</a></strong> is a visual graph in real time or from a saved log file providing data on specific computer components.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Task Manager has been discussed in a previous section, how to use it to monitor computer performance was not discussed. Access Task Manager and click the <em>Make Performance</em> tab. Task Manager immediately starts gathering CPU and memory usage statistics and displays them in graph form in the window as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig25">Figure 12.25</a>.</p>

<p class="notepara">You can add RAM; create multiple paging files when multiple hard drives are installed in the system; manually set the paging file size; run one application at a time; donât use Aero (Vista/7); close unnecessary windows; upgrade or add another hard drive; delete unused files; defragment the hard drive.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The first window on the left, CPU Usage, shows the processor usage percentage, or what percentage of time the processor is working. Actually, the percentage of time the processor is running a thread is a more accurate statement. A thread is a type of Windows object that runs application instructions. The window on the right, CPU Usage History, is a graph of how busy the processor is over a period of time.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_626"></a>The second window on the left for Windows XP is PF Usage, and it shows the amount of virtual memory (the paging file) being used. If the display shows that the paging file is near the maximum, you can adjust the page file size with the following steps:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Click the <em>Start</em> button and select <em>Control Panel</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Use the <em>Performance and Maintenance Control Panel</em> &gt; <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Advanced</em> tab &gt; <em>Performance</em> section <em>Settings</em> button.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Click the <em>Advanced</em> tab, locate the <em>Virtual Memory</em> section, and click the <em>Change</em> button.</p>
<p class="indent">In Vista or 7, the second window on the left displays memory usage for the current moment. The graphic on the right is memory usage over time. To see how much memory an individual process is using, use the <em>Processes</em> tab and locate the program executable file. The CPU and memory usage show in separate columns on the <em>Processes</em> tab.</p>
<p class="indent">Memory is a frequent bottleneck for computer performance issues. Task Manager can also be used to see the total amount of RAM installed and how much RAM is available. Look in the <em>Physical Memory</em> information section of the Task Manager <em>Performance</em> tab to see this information.</p>
<p class="indent">Task Manager also has the <em>Networking</em> tab that is useful to technicians. The <em>Networking</em> tab shows a graph of network performance. The information shown can also be changed by selecting the <em>View</em> menu option &gt; <em>Select Columns</em> option select appropriate checkboxes &gt; <em>OK</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes a computer can start slowing down. The most common cause of slowdown is that the computerâs resources are insufficient or an application is monopolizing a particular resource such as memory. Other causes of slowdowns include a resource that is not functioning properly or is outdated, such as a hard drive; a resource that is not configured for maximum performance and needs to be adjusted; or resources, such as hard drive space and memory, that are not sharing workloads properly and need to be adjusted.</p>
<p class="indent">Viewing system performance when a problem occurs is good, but it is easier if the normal performance is known. A baseline can help with this. A <strong><a id="ch12term03" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0071" class="pd_blue">baseline</a></strong> is a snapshot of computer performance during normal operations (before it has problems). Task Manager can be used to get an idea of what normal performance is, but the Windows XP System Monitor and Performance Logs and Alerts tools and the Windows Vista/7 Performance Monitor and Reliability Monitor tools are better suited to capturing and analyzing specific computer resource data.</p>
<p class="indent">To access the Windows XP Performance tool (which contains System Monitor and Performance Logs and Alerts), perform the following steps: From the <em>Start</em> menu &gt; <em>Control Panel</em> &gt; in <em>Category view</em> select <em>Performance and Maintenance</em> &gt; <em>Administrative Tools</em> &gt; double-click <em>Performance</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">Running any performance monitor tool affects the computer performance, especially when using the Graph view and sampling large amounts of data. The following steps help when running any performance monitoring tool:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Turn off any screen saver.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Use <em>Report</em> view instead of Graph view to save on resources.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><a id="page_629"></a><strong>3.</strong> Keep the number of counters being monitored to a minimum.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Sample at longer intervals such as 10 to 15 minutes rather than just a few seconds or minutes apart.</p>
<p class="indent">A tool that is only available in XP is Dr. Watson. Dr. Watson is a utility that automatically loads when an application starts. Dr. Watson can detect and display troubleshooting information as well as create a text log file (<code>drwtsn32.log</code>) when a system or application error occurs. A technician might need this information when communicating with Microsoft or the application developerâs technical support. Make notes of any messages that appear on the screen when any type of problem occurs.</p>
<p class="indent">To start Dr. Watson in Windows XP, click the <em>Start</em> button &gt; <em>Run</em> &gt; type <code>drwtsn32</code> and press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 12. Windows XP, Vista, and 7_files/enter.jpg" alt="Image" width="45" height="20"></span>. Click the application error and click the <em>View</em> button. The default location for the log file is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\DrWatson. When an error occurs, Dr. Watson appends information to the end of this log file.</p>
<p class="indent">Microsoft Vista and 7 do not include the Dr. Watson tool but has the Problem Reports and Solutions window instead. The settings allow Windows Vista/7 to automatically report problems and check for solutions, to check for solutions only when a problem occurs, or to report problems and check for solutions at any time. In Vista, access the <em>System and Maintenance</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Problem Reports and Solutions</em> link. In Windows 7, access the <em>System and Security</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>Action Center</em> &gt; <em>Maintenance</em> section. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig29">Figure 12.29</a> and notice the <em>Check for solutions</em> link.</p>

<p class="indent">The Vista/7 Reliability Monitor is also new, and it is used to give a visual and detailed report on the reliability of the computer by category. The details are to help technicians <a id="page_630"></a>troubleshoot the cause of something that causes the system to become unreliable. In Vista, the Reliability Monitor is found as an option within the Reliability and Performance Monitor. In Windows 7 it is a separate tool found by typing <code>reliability monitor</code> in the <em>Search programs and files</em> textbox from the <em>Start</em> menu. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig30">Figure 12.30</a> shows this tool.</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The remote desktop must have some type of network connectivity.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The computer used to access the remote desktop must run Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista/7 Professional or higher, Windows Server, or must have some type of terminal services running.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Any firewalls between the two computers must allow ports 3389 and 80 to be open.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The remote PC must have the Remote Desktop application installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ You need to know the computer name of the remote PC.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ You need to have a user account with a password on the remote PC.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you are on a computer that is remotely accessing another computer, there is a bar across the top of the screen that contains the remote computer name. This is how you know that you are on another computer. The user on the remote computer is logged off.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance are useful for those working a help desk and for technicians who must support computers located in other locations. With Remote Assistance, one computer user (the Expert) views another computer userâs (the Novice) desktop using a secure connection.</p>
<p class="indent">Remote Assistance (<code>msra</code> command) can be initiated using any of the following methods:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows Messenger service</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Email an invitation</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Send an invitation as an email attachment</p>

<p class="noindent">Your operating system is a key component of a working system. Preventive maintenance can help avoid issues and reduce downtime when properly applied. No application or hardware can work without an operating system. It is important that you keep your operating system healthy. The following suggestions can help:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Always have an antivirus software program that has current virus definitions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Make frequent data backups.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have a backup of your operating system. Many external hard drives include backup software. Remember that Windows XP Home and Vista Home Basic/Premium do not include a backup utility.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ensure that the System Restore utility is enabled.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Update the operating system with service packs and patches.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the Task Scheduler tool to automate some of the preventive maintenance tasks. You can use the <code>at</code> command (type <code>at /?</code> to see the options) to create a script file or have an application run at a specific time.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec36"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâAvoiding Burnout</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many technicians get tired of the fast pace of technology (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch12.html#ch12fig33">Figure 12.33</a>). As a person matures, it seems to takes more effort to stay current in the skills required for business. One of the attractions to technology for many students is how technology is always changing; however, it is this speed of change that provides such a challenge even to seasoned veterans. Sometimes, a technician is in the same job for more than three years, and burnout is evident. Burnoutâcommonly caused by too much work and stressâis a mental state that can also affect emotional and physical capabilities. Technicians should monitor their own attitude and mental state constantly and watch for warning signs associated with burnout:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Overreaction to common situations</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Constant tiredness</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Reduced productivity</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Poor attitude</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Lack of patience with customers or peers</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Feeling of a loss of control</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use of food, drink, or drugs as coping mechanisms</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 12.33.</span> Burnout</p>
<p class="indent">Burnout can be prevented and dealt with if it is recognized. Working too much, having too many responsibilities, and expecting too much of yourself can all lead to burnout. The following list can help you recognize and cope with burnout:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Take vacations during which you do not stay in contact with work.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Set reachable goals, even on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Take a couple breaks during the day and do something nontechnical.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Learn something new that is not related to technology.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have good eating, sleeping, and exercising routines.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Subscribe to a positive saying or joke of the day.</p>
<h3 id="ch12lev1sec37"><a id="page_634"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows operating systems can be 32-bit or 64-bit. The 32-bit versions are limited to a maximum of 4GB of RAM. 32-bit operating systems or applications are sometimes referred to as x86 instead of 32-bit.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows operating systems come in different editions that have various features and tools. For example, the Home versions cannot join corporate network domains or encrypt files/folders.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows XP has WFP and Windows Vista/7 have WRP to protect the key operating system files. <code>sfc /scannow</code> checks system files.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ There are specific operating system in-place upgrade paths that are permitted. Otherwise, a clean install must be performed. You must activate the Windows license by phone or Internet. A repair installation is performed when Windows has to be reloaded. Use the Upgrade Advisor before upgrading Windows.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Multiple operating systems can be installed. (Install the oldest one first, and install the operating systems on separate partitions.) Virtualization can also be used to have multiple operating systems installed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Compatibility mode, Windows XP Mode, or virtualization can be used to allow older applications to operate properly.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ No machine should be deployed without antivirus software installed. Symptoms of a virus include the computer not booting, computer running slowly, hard drive activity increases, files are missing, applications do not work or do not work properly, unusual messages or graphics appear, etc.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Corporate Windows deployment involves creating a master image and deploying that image across a network. Deployment methods include PXE boot, unattended installations. LTI, and remote network installation. Network bandwidth is affected by imaging.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Operating system installation failures are often caused by lack of planning for the installation: insufficient or incompatible hardware, incompatible software, and lack of operating-specific drivers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A computer that uses virtualization must have more hardware than a single operating system environment.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ To back up the Windows registry, use regedit, the Backup utility, or the System Restore tool.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Windows updates include device driver updates. Use the driver roll back feature or System Restore when an update causes the system to not work.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The Computer Management console is used to access System tools (Task Scheduler, Event Viewer, Shared Folders, Local Users and Groups, Performance, and Device Manager), Storage, and Services and Applications.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The Advanced Boot Options menu is commonly used when the tools within Windows cannot be used in the normal boot environment. The most commonly used options are Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, Enable low resolution (Vista/7), Last Known Good Configuration, Disable automatic restart on system failure (Vista/7), Disable driver signature enforcement (Vista/7), and Repair Your Computer (Vista/7).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The <code>bootrec</code> command can be used to detect and repair master boot issues, operating system files, or the boot sector.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The System Configuration utility (<code>msconfig</code>) can be used to control what applications load during the boot process.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Task Manager can be used to display system performance, stop applications that are not working properly, and to view which applications and processes are taking up memory.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Event Viewer logs issues with applications and the operating system to provide a historical record and timeline of when things occur.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_635"></a>â¢ Remote Assistance (the <code>msra</code> command) and Remote Desktop (the <code>mstsc</code> command) are used to control and use a remote computer. Remote Assistance displays a prompt requesting permission.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Task Scheduler can be used to perform preventive maintenance on a regular basis. Preventive maintenance can reduce downtime and includes keeping the operating system and applications patched, keeping the antivirus definitions current, and keeping the hard drive defragmented and with ample space.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Technicians can do positive things to avoid burnout including getting good rest, avoiding drugs and alcohol, do non-technical things, and have good time-management skills.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Enter the Windows product key as provided by the instructor or lab assistant. Note that the installation can proceed without a key. If Windows 7 or higher is being installed, select the Windows version from the drop down menu. Optionally, enter a username and password as directed by the instructor or lab assistant. Click <em>Next</em>. If a license key was not entered, you will be reminded of that and must click Yes to continue.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><a id="page_641"></a><span class="pd_blue">Was a username and password selected as part of this installation process? If so, document the username and password. [ Yes | No ]</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> Enter a name for the machine (or leave the default) and select a hard drive location to store the virtual machine file. Click <em>Next</em>.</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>7.</strong> Keep the default disk size unless instructed to change by the instructor or student assistant and select the <em>Store virtual disk as a single file</em> radio button. Click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>8.</strong> Look over the virtual machine settings.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">What is the default amount of RAM?</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">What type of network adapter is installed?</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">What other devices are automatically installed?</span></p>
<p class="enter">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>9.</strong> Notice that the <em>Power on this virtual machine after creation</em> checkbox is automatically enabled. Click <em>Finish</em>. Note that if you have removable devices attached, you may receive a message. Also, you will need a licensed version of VMware Workstation to power on any virtual machines. The Windows setup installation process begins if a proper ISO file was found. Answer the installation prompts just as you would a normal Windows installation process.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>10.</strong> Notice how the virtual machine is within its own tab. Right-click the tab that contains your new virtual machine.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">Document at least four available options that are available from the menu.</span></p>
<p class="enter">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indenthangingNP"><span class="pd_blue">Are the options the same as the ones you saw when you right-clicked the virtual machine tab? [ Yes | No ]</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>13.</strong> Select the <em>View</em> &gt; <em>Full Screen</em> menu options. The virtual machine displays in the full window, looking exactly like a typical Windows screen.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>14.</strong> Locate and click the VM icon in the top left corner. Select <em>Restore</em> to close full screen mode and return to the VMware Workstation area.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="pd_blue"><strong><em>Instructor initials:</em></strong> _____________</span></p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>15.</strong> Log in to the Windows environment and continue the installation process if necessary.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>16.</strong> Shut down the version of Windows being used within the virtual environment. It is very important to shut down the Windows version inside the virtual machine as it is to shut down Windows properly on an unvirtualized computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN1"><strong>17.</strong> Power off the virtual machine.</p>
