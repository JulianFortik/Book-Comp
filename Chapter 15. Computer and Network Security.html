<h3 id="ch15lev1sec1"><a id="page_812"></a><span class="pd_blue">Security Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Computer and network security relates to the hardware, software, and data protection of PCs and mobile devices. Large books are devoted to the topic of computer and network security. This chapter focuses on issues related to a PC technician job and the processes and terminology with which the technician should be familiar. Security needs to be a concern of everyone in a business or a home. And this, of course, also includes the people who repair and support PCsâthe technicians. A technician must be able to implement and explain security concepts. Every technician has the responsibility of promoting security consciousness and training users to be good stewards of equipment and data is essential.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec2"><span class="pd_blue">Security Policy</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A <strong><a id="ch15term25" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0870" class="pd_blue">security policy</a></strong> is one or more documents that provide rules and guidelines related to computer and network security. Every company, no matter what size or how many employees, should have a security policy. Small businesses tend to have general operating procedures that are passed verbally from one employee to another, but it is best to have these processes documented in detail.</p>
<p class="indent">Common elements of a security policy are shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab01">Table 15.1</a>.</p>
<p class="tab-caption"><a id="ch15tab01"></a><span class="pd_blue">Table 15.1.</span> Security policy elements</p>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15tab01.jpg" alt="Image" width="915" height="557"></div>
<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15tab01a.jpg" alt="Image" width="915" height="275"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_813"></a>Even though not every company has a security policy, specific points relating to the security policy are referenced throughout this chapter. Whether written or just accepted company guidelines, many implementations are based on a particular companyâs rules for computer and network security.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec3"><span class="pd_blue">Physical Security</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Typical physical security includes door locks, cipher locks, keys, guards, and fences, but physical security regarding computers can mean much more. For several years, companies have been using electronic key cards for physical access to rooms instead of keys. Electronic key cards are part of an access control system which includes the key cards, door readers, and software to control and monitor the system. Electronic key cards have many benefits, including the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ They are easy to program and issue/revoke compared to issuing a key and getting it back from a dismissed employee or one who quits.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Data is stored in a database instead of in a checkout form.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Watch out for tailgating</span></p>
<p class="notepara"><strong><a id="ch15term30" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0974" class="pd_blue">Tailgating</a></strong> is the practice of an unauthorized person entering behind an authorized person. Prevention of tailgating requires training and diligence by all employees.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Access to information, such as who entered a room and at what time, can be logged and monitored more easily than with a checkout sheet.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ More layers of control can be exercised with key cards. With metal keys, the usual process is to give a key for each room, issue a submaster key for an entire wing, or issue a master key for the entire building.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When keys are issued and one is lost, the lock must be rekeyed and new keys issued. When an electronic key card is lost, the old card is deactivated, and a new one is issued.</p>
<p class="indent">Other electronic devices and technologies also provide access to computers and rooms. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab02">Table 15.2</a> lists and describes security devices that help with the physical security of computers.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_814"></a>Smart cards or security tokens are often described as using two-factor authentication. This type of authentication is familiar to most peopleâyou need something you have, such as your ATM card or your security token device, and something you know, such as a PIN number. This is more secure than a password, which is only one factor. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig01">Figure 15.1</a> shows a smart card, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig02">Figure 15.2</a> illustrates a key fob, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig03">Figure 15.3</a> shows a photo of a security token.</p>

<p class="indent">An expanding field related to this is <strong><a id="ch15term06" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0080" class="pd_blue">biometrics</a></strong>, which is authenticating (proving who someone is) based on one or more physical traits such as a fingerprint, eyeball (retina), or hand. Behavioral traits, such as voice and signature, can also be used. Voice can actually be both physical and behavioral. A less complex system could just compare voice with a stored voice print. The more complex systems compare tone and inflection too, which is more in the behavioral realm.</p>
<p class="indent">Multifactor authentication is when two or more methods are required to gain access to a computer, network room, or other shared media. Using a bank ATM requires multifactor authentication: (1) the ATM card and (2) a PIN code. With computers, one of the two things could be something the users know such as a password or PIN and the second security measure could be a token, smart card, USB security key device, or a biometric device such as a fingerprint reader or face recognition through a webcam. Biometrics add one more security layer to authentication.</p>
<p class="indent">Biometrics are more secure because a biometric system is more difficult to bypass than are a user ID and password. The trait is less likely to be lost than a password. Also, biometrics requires that the person being authenticated is present when gaining access. Biometrics is more expensive to implement than a user ID/password scheme. Examples of biometric devices used to allow someone to gain access to a room, locker, or device are listed in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab03">Table 15.3</a>.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15tab03.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="503"></div>
<p class="indent">Applications for biometric devices are not limited to computer/network security. Disney World uses biometrics to ensure that the same person uses a multiday pass. Airports use biometrics for employee-only area access. Police departments use biometrics to gain access to evidence and gun lockers. These devices will need to be installed and maintained by the computer and network support staff. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig04">Figures 15.4</a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig05">15.5</a> show a fingerprint scanner and a retinal scanner.</p>

<p class="noindent">Several chapters have contained important security-related tips, steps, and information related to protecting the operating system and data. Some of the most important ones follow:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the NTFS file system.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ensure that operating system and application service packs and updates are applied regularly (good patch management). If a Windows update fails, a message usually appears when the machine reboots. Try the update again; sometimes an update might fail when being installed with other updates. Successfully install as many as you can and then re-install the failed updates one by one.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Install antivirus software with the latest virus definitions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Encrypt data that needs to be protected.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use BitLocker, BitLocker To Go, and TPM (Trusted Platform Module). <strong><a id="ch15term07" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0083" class="pd_blue">BitLocker</a></strong> encrypts an entire disk volume and requires two NTFS disk partitions. <strong><a id="ch15term08" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0084" class="pd_blue">BitLocker To Go</a></strong> is used to encrypt and password protect external drives and removable media that are 128MB are larger. Use BitLocker To Go Reader on a Windows XP or Vista machine to use a drive that has been encrypted with BitLocker To Go.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Optionally place operating system files and data files on separate hard drive partitions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Some firmware or driver versions may cause security issues. Keep the versions updated.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If using virtualization, donât forget that each virtual machine needs the same protection as an individual computer. All concepts in this chapter apply not just to the host machine, but to each virtual machine as well.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If donating an older computer or replacing a hard drive, the data needs to be removed and partition(s) deleted and re-created; some hard drive manufacturers have utilities that rewrite a hard drive with all 1s or all 0s to prevent data remnants from being recovered. A company that has extremely sensitive data stored on a hard drive should destroy the hard drive by (1) secure erasing, which requires special software, (2) degaussing (using electromagnets to change the drives magnetic fields or 1s and 0s; can be expensive and requires drive disassembly), or (3) drilling through drive platters (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig07">Figure 15.7</a>) and then destroying the pieces with a hammer.</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use the System Protection program to control restore points. Use the <em>System</em> Control Panel &gt; <em>System Protection</em> link or in Explorer, right-click <em>Computer</em> &gt; <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>System Protection</em> link &gt; <em>System Protection</em> tab &gt; <em>Configure</em>. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15lev2sec2">Lab 15.2</a> for details.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disable USB ports through the BIOS and password protect the BIOS to prevent using external USB drives that might have a virus.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disable AutoRun to prevent software or programs from automatically starting from an optical disc, flash drive, or external drive. Note that AutoPlay is when you insert a disc such as a music CD and the music automatically starts playing or the user is prompted for the default action. Use the following steps to disable AutoPlay and AutoRun so the action will not occur and the user will not be prompted. Note that specific Windows security updates are also required (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/">http://support.microsoft.com</a> for more details):</p>
<p class="indenthangingBN"><strong>1.</strong> From a command prompt or the Start textbox, type <code>gpedit.msc</code> and press <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/enter.jpg" alt="Image" width="45" height="20"></span></p>
<p class="indenthangingBN"><strong>2.</strong> Expand <em>Administrative Templates</em> &gt; click <em>System</em> (XP) or expand <em>Windows Components</em> (Vista/7).</p>
<p class="indenthangingBN"><strong>3.</strong> On an XP computer, right-click <em>Turn off Autoplay</em> &gt; <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Enabled</em> &gt; <em>All drives</em> &gt; <em>Turn off Autoplay</em> &gt; <em>OK</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingBN"><strong>4.</strong> On a Vista/7 computer, click <em>Autoplay Policies</em> &gt; double-click <em>Turn off Autoplay</em> &gt; click <em>Enabled</em> &gt; select <em>All drives</em> &gt; restart the computer.</p>
<p class="indent">If you suspect that a system has a virus because the computer is running slow, crashes, or locks; applications are behaving abnormally or not at all; files are missing; file attributes have changed; the hard drive is constantly active; the network is constantly active; email is hijacked; you get access denied messages; or system files are renamed or removed, check for updated virus signatures from the antivirus software vendor. Disconnect the computer from the network or disable the wireless NIC to prevent the virus from spreading to other computers. Run an antivirus program. You might be required to use the <code>SFC /scannow</code> command after removing a virus.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_820"></a>If you donât have antivirus software installed, download Microsoft Security Essentials or another free antivirus program. Ensure that the free antivirus program is from a reputable download site. There are rogue antivirus websites that post programs that are actually viruses.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Manually delete files, if necessary</span></p>
<p class="notepara">If the antivirus software or other preventive software applications state that a particular file cannot be deleted, make a note of the file and its location. Explorer view options may have to be adjusted before viewing/deletion can occur.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">If the system still performs unusually, try booting into Safe Mode and running the virus checker from there. If you purchased an antivirus disc, run the software from the optical disc. Go to another computer to research your support options from your antivirus software vendor. Boot from an alternate boot source (flash drive, external hard drive, operating system disc). Some antivirus software vendors have bootable discs with antivirus software that can be downloaded.</p>
<p class="indent">Some worms and Trojan Horse viruses require that files be manually deleted because they cannot be repaired, but the antivirus software will âquarantineâ the file so it cannot be dangerous and affect other files. Test all applications to ensure that they operate. Then manually delete the file that is quarantined.</p>

<p class="notepara">When you share a folder, all subfolders are automatically shared unless you make the subfolders private.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Besides backing it up, the following are several things you can do to protect your locally stored data:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer you are using does not need to share files or a printer with others on the network, use the <em>Network</em> Control Panel and disable <em>File and Printer Sharing</em> (XP) or use the <em>Network and Sharing Center</em> (Vista/7) <em>Control Panel</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ To create a shared folder that is not seen by any others across the network, add a $ (dollar sign) to end of the share name. An example of a hidden shared folder is Book$.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ In XP, make any folder in your user profile private such as <em>My Documents</em>, <em>Desktop</em>, <em>Start Menu</em>, <em>Cookies</em>, and <em>Favorites</em> (or any subfolder of these). Note that Vista/7 does not support private folders. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15lev2sec3">Lab 15.3</a> at the end of this chapter demonstrates these techniques.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Encrypt (scramble so they cannot be read) files or folders.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of quarantined files or the need to check system files, a technician is required to be very familiar with Windows Explorer display options. In Windows XP, use the Windows Explorer <em>Tools</em> &gt; <em>Folder Options</em> &gt; <em>View</em> tab. In Windows Vista and 7, use the <em>Organize</em> &gt; <em>Folder and search options</em> &gt; <em>View</em> tab. Also in Vista/7 Windows Explorer, you can use the use the <em>Organize</em> &gt; <em>Layout</em> option or the <em>Folder Options</em> Control Panel to configure how folders/files are displayed and what information is included with that display. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab05">Table 15.5</a> summarizes the security-related <em>View</em> tab options.</p>

<p class="notepara">A maximum of 10 users (XP) or 20 users (Vista/7) can simultaneously use the same shared folder.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">NTFS volumes can have files, folders, and subfolders encrypted using <strong><a id="ch15term13" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0315" class="pd_blue">EFS</a></strong> (Encrypting File System). The EFS algorithm originally used DES (Data Encryption standard), which uses 56-or 128-bit encryption, but now the EFS algorithm uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), smart-cardâbased encryption, and in Windows 7, ECC (elliptical curve cryptography).</p>
<p class="indent">When a folder or subfolder is encrypted, all newly created files within the folder or subfolder are automatically encrypted. If any files are copied or moved into an encrypted folder or subfolder, those files are automatically encrypted. System files cannot be encrypted. EFS can use a CA (certificate authority) such as one issued from a server or use a self-signed certificate as demonstrated in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15lev2sec1">Lab 15.1</a> at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p class="notepara">The answer is yes if you have the write attribute, create files/write data, and list folder/read data permissions for the file.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Some data from computers must be printed as part of normal business operations. Some printed material must be kept in a locked environment (such as a safe, cabinet, or file cabinet). When the material is no longer needed, it can be shredded by a shredding service or using a shredder in the office (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig08">Figure 15.8</a>). Shredders are available for reasonable prices, but they are not the best option in a corporate environment because reconstruction can be done with most models. For day-to-day business and personal documents, shredding is still a good practice to keep other people from taking documents out of the trash bin (dumpster diving) and using the information for mal gain.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong><a id="ch15term10" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0222" class="pd_blue">DEP</a></strong> is a security measure implemented in both hardware and software to prevent malicious software from running on a Windows-based computer. DEP is always on and enabled for 64-bit versions of Windows, but the policy can be managed. With DEP that is hardware-based, the CPU supports enforcing no execute (AMD processors) or execute disable (Intel processors). The processor marks memory with an attribute indicating that data inside that memory location should not be executable (it should just be another type of data or code). Different processors have different capabilities, but at a minimum, the processor can display a message if code tries to execute from those memory locations marked as no execute or execute disable.</p>
<p class="indent">With software-enforced DEP, if a program tries to run from a memory location that should not have executable code, the application is closed and a message appears. Software-enforced DEP is available in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and higher and all versions of Vista and 7. To see this feature in Vista or 7, <em>System</em> (Vista) or <em>System and Security</em> (7) Control Panel &gt; <em>System</em> (7) &gt; <em>Advanced System Settings</em> link &gt; <em>Settings</em> button in the <em>Performance</em> area &gt; <em>Data Execution Prevention</em> tab. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig09">Figure 15.9</a> shows the two options.

<h3 id="ch15lev1sec6"><a id="page_823"></a><span class="pd_blue">Protecting Access to Local and Network Resources</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Several techniques exist to protect computer access, and some of them have been considered as part of physical access. Authentication is used to determine what network resources can be used. <strong><a id="ch15term05" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0061" class="pd_blue">Authorization</a></strong> is the part of the operating system or network controls in place to determine what resources such as files, folders, printers, video conferencing equipment, scanners, and so on, can be accessed and used.</p>
<p class="indent">A great analogy for authentication is the clubhouse that many of us made as children. A secret tap at the door or a special password was the only way to gain access to the private domain. Most people are familiar with the user ID and password method of authentication. Other means could be used including the previously discussed biometric devices. All of these provide an additional layer of security beyond the user ID and password method. Windows and other operating systems and applications use the Kerberos protocol to provide authentication. Kerberos uses a KDC (key distribution center) to authenticate users, applications, and services. Password protection is a common method used though, and some password guidelines are listed in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab06">Table 15.6</a>.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_824"></a>Windows allows several user ID and password options, including the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Local user ID and password created and maintained on the local PC</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Computer that is part of the workgroup where the user ID and password are created, stored, and maintained on the local computer (similar to the local PC)</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Computer that is part of a domain and the user ID and password are created, stored, and maintained on a centralized network server</p>
<p class="indent">A workgroup or peer-to-peer environment is a LAN where each computer maintains its own networked resources, such as whether a file or printer is shared with others. Workgroup networks are more common in home and small business environments. A domain environment is more common in the business world where network servers are used to authenticate logins, provide for file storage, and provide services such as email and web access. Another name for a domain environment is a server-based network. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig10">Figure 15.10</a> illustrates a workgroup environment; <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig11">Figure 15.11</a> shows how a domain environment is different.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 15.11.</span> Windows domain model</p>
<p class="indent">Some companies use single sign-on for user authentication. Single sign-on allows a user to authenticate with a minimum of a user ID and password. With that authentication, the user is allowed access to multiple systems/servers, devices such as printers, copiers, and even networked based applications. The alternative is that the users are prompted to authenticate or log in each time they access such network connections as the work computer, email, or the shared files server.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether in a local- or domain-based network, users can be added and placed into groups for ease of management. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab07">Table 15.7</a> shows the default local users/groups for Windows XP and 7. Note that in Windows Vista/7 home versions local groups are not supported.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15tab07a.jpg" alt="Image" width="770" height="350"></div>
<p class="indent">Another method of controlling login passwords is through a local- or domain-based account policy. Policies can define the desktop, what applications are available to users, what options are available through the <em>Start</em> menu, whether users are allowed to save files to external media, and so on. A domain or group policy can be created and applied to every computer on the domain.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_826"></a>A local policy is created on a computer, and it could be used to disable auto-playing of optical discs, prevent users from shutting down or restarting a computer, turn off personalized menus, or keep someone from changing the Internet Explorer home page. A local policy might be implemented in a workgroup setting. A group policy is more common in a corporate environment, and a group policy can overwrite a local policy. The local policy is accessed by typing <code>gpedit.msc</code> from a command prompt or in the <em>Search</em> textbox in Windows Vista/7. The <code>secedit</code> command is used to configure or analyze the security policy.</p>
<p class="indent">Passwords continue to be an issue today for everyone. Different requirements, user IDs, and passwords, cause stress for many folks. A password manager is an application that is on one computer or a USB drive, mobile app, or web browser plug-in that locally or remotely stores passwords used to access an account. When stored remotely, the passwords and associated data (site, device, etc.) should be encrypted.</p>
<p class="indent">Through the defined policy, criteria for auditing can also be set. <strong><a id="ch15term03" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0059" class="pd_blue">Auditing</a></strong>, sometimes called event logging or just logging, is the process of tracking events that occur on the network such as someone logging into the network. In the business environment, a server with special auditing software is sometimes devoted to this task because it is so important to security. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15lev2sec6">Lab 15.6</a> at the end of this chapter details how to configure a local security policy, log events, and view those audited items. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig12">Figure 15.12</a> shows the Local Group Policy Editor window.</p>

<p class="indent">File and folder security protection is also a concern. A subfolder and any files created within that subfolder all inherit security permissions from the parent folder or the folder that contains the subfolder. This feature can be disabled when necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Files and folders can be shared in a network workgroup, a homegroup, or a domain. A <strong><a id="ch15term18" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0542" class="pd_blue">local share</a></strong> is somethingâa printer, folder, or media deviceâthat is shared on a specific computer. <strong><a id="ch15term01" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0018" class="pd_blue">Administrative shares</a></strong> are shares created by Microsoft for drive volumes and the folder that contains the majority of Window files. An example of an administrative share is a drive volume letter (such as C) followed by the dollar sign ($) symbol (C$). The admin$ administrative share is used to access to the folder that contains the Windows operating system files.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_827"></a>Windows automatically creates these administrative shares, but by default Windows Vista and 7 prevent local accounts from accessing administrative shares through the network. If this feature is desired in Windows Vista or 7, a registry edit must be made. In Windows XP, the <code>net share</code> <span class="EmpItalic">share_name</span><code>$ /delete</code> command can be used to disable a particular administrative share. However, this is reset when the computer is restarted. A batch file could be created and put in the startup folder to make this a more permanent solution.</p>
<p class="indent">Any local share can be made a <strong><a id="ch15term16" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0437" class="pd_blue">hidden share</a></strong>, which is a share that is not seen by default through the network. To make a share a hidden share, add the dollar sign ($) symbol to the share name. This might be beneficial to a computer user who wants to access something from his or her remote computer without making it visible to other network users.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Permissions</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Monitoring the users and groups and the devices, data, and applications they have access to is important. Permissions control what can or cannot be done to files, folders, and devices from a remote connection. User-assigned permissions can cause havoc. Network administrators and end users can set permissions on folders, and these permissions can affect another userâs access to files and folders. Technicians need to be familiar with permissions.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of permissions that can be assigned in Windows: shared folder permissions and NTFS file/folder permissions. Shared folder permissions provide access to data across a network. Shared folder permissions are the only way to secure network resources on FAT16 or FAT32 drives. NTFS file/folder permissions provide tighter control than shared folder permissions. NTFS permissions can be used only on NTFS drives.</p>
<p class="indent">In XP, to share a folder using shared folder permissions, locate the folder using <em>Explorer</em> &gt; right-click the folder &gt; <em>Sharing and Security</em> &gt; <em>Sharing</em> tab &gt; <em>Share this folder</em>. Permissions are set by clicking the <em>Permissions</em> button. Besides sharing this folder and allowing access to another user across the network, you can limit the number of users who can access this folder. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig13">Figure 15.13</a> shows this window.</p>

<p class="notepara">You can enable or disable password protection through the Network and Sharing Center on a workgroup/homegroup computer. If password protection is enabled, the person accessing the folder from a remote location must have a user account and password on the computer with the share.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 support sharing a folder in a similar fashion as XP, but they use a new folder called the Public folder. The default path for the Public folder is C:\Users\Public. You can copy or move any files to the Public folder. This makes it easier to share files with someone, but files that are copied into it take twice as much hard drive space because they are in two folders.</p>
<p class="indent">If sharing is enabled for the Public folder, anyone with a user account and password on the computer that contains the data, in addition to any user on the network, can see all files and folders in the Public folder. You can set permissions so that the folder is inaccessible or restrict anyone from changing files or creating new files. However, you cannot pick and choose what files can be seen by individuals.</p>
<p class="indent">In Vista/7, to share a folder other than the Public folder, use <em>Windows Explorer</em> &gt; right-click the folder &gt; <em>Share</em> (Vista)/<em>Share with</em> (7). You can do one of the following at this point:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Type the name of the person and click Add.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer is attached to a network domain, click the arrow to the right of the textbox &gt; <em>Find</em> &gt; type the name of the person with whom you want to share the folder &gt; <em>Check Names</em> &gt; <em>OK</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer is on a workgroup, click the arrow to the right of the textbox, click the appropriate name, and click <em>Add</em>. If the name does not appear, click the arrow to the right of the textbox and click <em>Create a new user</em> to create the user account.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the computer is part of a homegroup, you can select <em>Homegroup (Read)</em> or <em>Homegroup (Read/Write)</em> and the folder will be shared with the appropriate permissions.</p>

<p class="indent">Windows 7 uses libraries. A library is similar to a folder, but a library contains files that are automatically indexed for faster searching, viewing, and access. For example, a teacher might store training video clips in a library and share them from a library. This library could contain files from different folders, an external drive, or even a network share.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows 7 is configured to have four default libraries: Documents, Printers, Music, and Videos. Explorer automatically shows the Documents library instead of the traditional My Documents (XP and below) or Documents (Vista/7). If you right-click the Documents library and select Properties, you can see that both a particular userâs Documents folder is shown as well as a public Documents folder. Notice the <em>Include a folder</em> button in this window, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig14">Figure 15.14</a>. This button allows more folders to be included in the Documents library. No matter the source of the files, they are all controlled through a single library as if the contents were stored in a single location. Each default library has two locations configured as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig14">Figure 15.14</a>. The public location is used by any user logged onto the computer. Only one location can be configured as the default save location for files that are moved, copied, or saved to the library.</p>

<p class="indent">Some people find Windows Vista/7 folder sharing more difficult than sharing in Windows XP. The Windows XP method can be used in Vista/7 by right-clicking a folder and selecting <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Sharing</em> tab &gt; <em>Advanced Sharing</em> button &gt; enable the <em>Share this folder</em> checkbox &gt; <em>Permissions</em> button. To share files on a home network, create a homegroup. In Windows 7 Home Basic and Starter, you can only join a homegroup, not create one. Right-click a folder and use the <em>Share with</em> menu option.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also share files and folders by using the Public folder. In Windows Explorer, expand any of the libraries and notice the Public folder, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig15">Figure 15.15</a>. Drop a file or folder into one of these Public folders, and others have access. Note that âPublicâ file sharing is turned off by default, and you cannot restrict individual files within any of the Public folders.</p>

For example, if a folder is given the Read permission, then all files within that folder cannot be changed (they are read-only). If a subfolder is created, it inherits that permission. If the allow/deny checkboxes for any object are selected, the current permissions have been inherited.</p>
<p class="indent">There can also be issues when copying or moving is performed on objects that have NTFS permissions set. Here are some guidelines for copying and moving:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When you copy a file/folder on the same or different NTFS drive letter, the copy inherits the destination folder permissions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When you move a file/folder on the same NTFS drive letter, the original permissions of the object are retained.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_832"></a>â¢ When you move a file/folder to a different NTFS drive letter, the moved object inherits the destination folder permissions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When you copy or move a file/folder to a drive that is using a different file system (like FAT), the object loses all of its permissions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If you change permissions on a folder that already has content, only the new content inherits the changed permissions.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch15term12" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0314" class="pd_blue">Effective permissions</a></strong> are the final permissions granted to a person for a particular resource. Effective permissions are important when you combine shared folder permissions given to an individual, shared folder permissions given to a group, and individual permissions. The list that follows outlines some helpful tips when sharing folders and files across a network:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Folder permissions are cumulativeâwhen you grant folder permissions to a group and then grant an individual permissions to that same folder, the effective permissions for that person is the combination of what the group gets and what the person gets. For example, if the group gets the Write permission and the person gets only the Read permission (and the person is a member of the group that has the Write permission), the person can both read and write files to the folder.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Deny overrides any allowed permission set for a user or a group. For example, if a group is denied access to a folder, but a person is specifically allowed access to the folder, the person is not allowed to access the folder.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When NTFS and shared folder permissions are both used, the most restrictive of the two is the effective permissions.</p>
<p class="indent">Windows Vista and 7 provide help in determining effective permissions. In Windows 7, right-click a file or folder &gt; <em>Properties</em> &gt; <em>Security</em> tab &gt; <em>Advanced</em> button &gt; <em>Effective Permissions</em> tab (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig18">Figure 15.18</a>).

<p class="noindent">The Internet is commonly accessed through a browser, and configuring the browser is one of the first steps to configuring security. Browsers are commonly upgraded to provide improved security options. Before upgrading an Internet browser, you must determine the current web browser version. With many Windows-based applications, the version is determined by starting the application, clicking <em>Help</em> &gt; <em>About x</em> (where <em>x</em> is the name of the application), or selecting the question mark menu item. With Internet Explorer (IE), the first two numbers listed are the software version numbers. There is another value called cipher strength that is a bit value for encryption; <strong><a id="ch15term14" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0322" class="pd_blue">encryption</a></strong> is a protection method used to change data so it cannot be recognized.

<p class="notepara">Internet hackers frequently target browsers, and constant updates are provided to counter these attacks.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">When people connect to the Internet, they normally do so through a web browser. Any web browser can usually be configured for various security options. Since Microsoft operating systems ship with Internet Explorer, it is covered here. But similar options are available in most browsers.</p>
<p class="indent">One issue with browsers is that they can be hijacked (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig19">Figure 15.19</a>). A hijacked browser either replaces the home page with another one or directs whatever web page is being used to a different one. This is called a browser redirect. Besides sending you to another web page, a browser redirect can also be used to install a rootkit or install more malware (bad software) that includes keystroke loggers (to record your keystrokes including your ID and password), DNS hijack, or a rogue HOSTS file. A <strong><a id="ch15term24" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0836" class="pd_blue">rootkit</a></strong> can be used to act as a backdoor to your operating system and may be used to do things that require administrator access. Rootkits can also be downloaded and installed to a flash drive. The HOSTS file is a text file used to manually map a hostname to a particular IP address. The following recommendations can help with a hijacked browser issue:</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch15fig19"></a><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15fig19.jpg" alt="Image" width="500" height="333"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 15.19.</span> Hijacking</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Change the home page URL to your normal home page and not the hijacked page. In Internet Explorer, browse to the web page you want to be the home page. In Internet Explorer 9, right-click the Home icon. In Internet Explorer 7 or 8, click the down arrow next to the Home icon. &gt; <em>Add or Change Home Page</em> &gt; <em>Use this webpage as your only home page</em> &gt; <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_834"></a>â¢ If pop-ups appear continuously, use Task Manager to stop the <code>iexplore.exe</code> process. Re-open Internet Explorer and ensure the pop-up blocker is turned on: <em>Internet Options</em> &gt; <em>Privacy</em> tab &gt; enable <em>Turn on Pop-up Blocker</em>. Otherwise, use an alternative browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If necessary, start the computer in Safe Mode with Networking. If the web browser works properly, a DLL file has been added to the computer. Run a scan with your antivirus or antispyware application. Otherwise, you can download and install Microsoft Security Essentials for free.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Start the browser with no add-ons to see if one of them is causing the problem. How you do this depends on the browser. In Internet Explorer, perform the following: <em>Start</em> &gt; <em>All Programs</em> &gt; <em>Accessories</em> &gt; <em>System tools</em> &gt; <em>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</em>. If the browser starts working, turn on the add-ons one by one to determine which one caused the problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Determine whether the HOSTS file has been modified and includes some rogue entries. The HOSTS file can be found in the folder C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc folder.</p>
<p class="indent">Spam is another problem. <strong><a id="ch15term28" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0928" class="pd_blue">Spam</a></strong> comes in unsolicited email from a company or person previously unknown. People who send this type of email are known as spammers. Most email applications have spam filters, but they cannot catch all of them. Most email applications also allow you to create a rule to block messages from a particular source or subject line. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig20">Figure 15.20</a> demonstrates the concept of a spam filter.</p>

<p class="indent">Other issues related to email include email messages being sent in clear text. If such an email is intercepted, the message is easy to read. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) are frequently used to provide encryption and authentication for email messages.</p>
<p class="indent">Avoid checking email on a public computer or an unsecure network. If an email account gets hijacked (the user cannot log in using normal procedures, contacts in response to constant emails or spam from the hijacked account, or the account has a lot of undeliverable emails), then perform the following steps:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Contact the email account company to report the problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Ensure that Windows, antivirus, and antimalware software updates have been applied.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you have an alternate email account available when you have to register with a site, such as for online shopping.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Try logging in to the account from a different computer to see if email settings have been changed. If you can get to the account, change the password.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Create rules in your email account to delete files from specific nontrusted sources.</p>

<p class="indent">Active scripting is an important security setting in a web browser. Active scripts are programs written for the Internet and are used on news sites, online shopping sites, and web-based email sites to make a web page more dynamic and one that constantly changes. However, some active scripting can be harmful because it can be used as a mechanism to transmit a worm virus into the computer. For this reason, a technician should define what Internet sites are often used that might be programmed with scripting. If active scripting is used on a site not listed, a message appears on the screen and you can either view the page or refuse it.</p>

<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Port number of the proxy server</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Optionally a username and password, but some organizations use server-based authentication</p>
<p class="indent">To configure Internet Explorer to use a proxy server, use the <em>Internet Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu bar option &gt; <em>Connections</em> tab &gt; <em>LAN Settings</em> button &gt; select the <em>Use a proxy server for your LAN</em> checkbox &gt; in the <em>Address</em> textbox, type the proxy server IP address &gt; type the proxy server port number in the <em>Port</em> textbox. This information can be obtained from the companyâs network administrator or through <strong><a id="ch15term38" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1100" class="pd_blue">WPAD</a></strong> (Web Proxy AutoDiscovery) protocol. Click the <em>Advanced</em> button to set individual IP addresses and port numbers for different protocols. Note that if you donât want the proxy server to be used when accessing resources in the local domain (and speed up this type of access), select the <em>Bypass proxy server for local addresses</em> checkbox. Improperly configured proxy settings can cause the computer to be redirected to an invalid website and have no Internet connectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">Computer security is a huge concern. If a computer connects to the Internet, it should be connected behind a firewall. A <strong><a id="ch15term15" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0370" class="pd_blue">firewall</a></strong> protects one or more computers from outside attacks. The concept of a firewall is similar to building a moat with a drawbridge around a castle. The castle is the inside network, the moat with the drawbridge is the firewall, and all outside the castle are âattackers.â The drawbridge can control who or what has access to the castle and who or what leaves the castle.</p>

<p class="notepara">A computer protected by a firewall still needs antivirus and antispyware applications for protection. Having a firewall on each computer as well as on a router or modem that connects to the Internet (or a device dedicated to providing firewall services) is common in both home and business environments.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">A firewall can be a software application or hardware and should be implemented for any computer that connects to another network, especially a computer that connects to the Internet. A firewall keeps hackers from accessing a computer that connects to the Internet. A software firewall is a good solution for individual computers. A hardware firewall is a good solution for home and business networks. Both can be used concurrently. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig24">Figure 15.24</a> shows the concept of a firewall.</p>

<p class="noindent">Many companies define what to do when a security incident has occurred. However, in some businesses or in an incident that occurs on a home network, people are not always sure what to do. These are the steps to take:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Identify the issue. (See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15tab15">Table 15.15</a> for issues and best practices.)</p>

<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Report the issue through the proper channels.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Preserve the data/device by documenting the incident and creating a chainâof-custody form that travels with the data/device as more people get involved. Chain-of-custody forms commonly have the following information.</p>
<p class="indenthangingNB">â¢ What is the issue (data/device/etc.)?</p>
<p class="indenthangingNB">â¢ How did you get involved with the evidence?</p>
<p class="indenthangingNB">â¢ When did you see the issue?</p>
<p class="indenthangingNB">â¢ What did you do to handle the issue?</p>
<p class="indenthangingNB">â¢ To what person did you turn over the issue, data, device, etc.?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_844"></a>If a security incident occurs, and you do not know what to do, talk to your supervisor. He or she should have the experience to guide you or know to whom he or she should go to resolve the issue.

Reporting and documenting security violations is very important, especially in the business environment and it is every personâs responsibility to be security-aware and responsible.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec10"><span class="pd_blue">Wireless Network Security Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Security has been a big concern with wireless network installers because most people are not familiar with network or wireless security. A Bluetooth wireless PAN is secure because it uses a modified version of SAFER+ (Secure and Fast Encryption Routine). However, wireless LANs tend to not be secure. Wireless access points (APs) are an integral part of a wireless LAN and normally mounted in the ceiling or on the wall where they are conspicuous. Normal networking equipment such as hubs, switches, routers, and servers are locked in a cabinet or behind a locked door in a wiring closet. Customized cabinets can be purchased to secure APs indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p class="indent">Data transmitted over air can be in clear text, which means that with special frame capturing software on a computer with a wireless NIC installed, the data can be captured and viewed. Negotiation between the wireless devices and the AP can be in clear text and that information can be captured. All frames include a source MAC address and someone with a computer with a wireless NIC installed can capture the frame, use the MAC address to gain access to other resources. (This is known as session hijacking or MAC spoofing.) By default, most APs transmit their SSIDs in clear text. All of these issues must be considered when installing a wireless network.</p>

<p class="notepara">A firewall can protect a computer connected to a wireless network; however, the firewall cannot prevent the data being sent wirelessly from being hijacked. The firewall simply protects a hacker from accessing the computer.</p>
<hr></div>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec11"><span class="pd_blue">Wireless Authentication and Encryption</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The original 802.11 standards define two mechanisms for wireless security: authentication and data confidentiality. The two types of authentication are open and shared key. <strong><a id="ch15term19" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0668" class="pd_blue">Open authentication</a></strong> allows a wireless network device to send a frame to the access point with the senderâs identity (MAC address). Open authentication is used when no authentication is required. <strong><a id="ch15term26" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0889" class="pd_blue">Shared key authentication</a></strong> requires the use of a shared key, which is a group of characters that the wireless network device and access point must have in common. Shared key authentication does not scale well with larger wireless networks because each device must be configured with the shared key authentication (very time-consuming), the users must be told of the shared key and their individual stations configured for this, or a server is used to provide the shared key automatically. Also, when manually input shared keys are used, the key is not changed very often which leads to security issues. (See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig29">Figure 15.29</a>.)</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 15.29.</span> Wireless security keys</p>
<p class="indent">APs that support 802.1x authentication use some form of EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol). When any type of EAP is used, the user or client to be authenticated is called a <em>supplicant</em>. An authentication server holds valid usernames and passwords. The device that is in the middle that takes the client request and passes it on to the server is known as the authenticator. An AP can be an authenticator.</p>
<p class="indent">When shared key authentication is being used, WEP must be enabled. <strong><a id="ch15term34" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1081" class="pd_blue">WEP</a></strong> (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encrypts data being transmitted. Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format. WEP commonly has two versions: 64-bit and 128-bit. Some vendors may have 256-bit. 64- and 128-bit WEP may also be seen as 40- and 104-bit. This is because each of the two versions uses a 24-bit initialization vector: 40 plus 24 equals 64 and 104 plus 24 equals 128. Sometimes you might even see that in documentation or website wording, the author mixes the two types of numbers, such as 40-bit and 128-bit, so it can be confusing.</p>

<p class="notepara">If 64-bit WEP is being used, five 5 characters are entered (5 times 8 bitsâ1 for each ASCII characterâequals 40 bits) or 10 hexadecimal characters (10 times four bitsâ1 for each hexadecimal characterâequals 40 bits).

<p class="indent">With WEP enabled, the shared âsecretâ key is normally entered into the wireless NIC configuration window. Vendors have a variety of ways of inputting this alphanumeric key, but normally it is input in either hexadecimal or ASCII characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_846"></a>Some wireless NIC manufacturers allow entering multiple WEP keys; however, only one key is used at a time.

<p class="indent">Notice in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig30">Figure 15.30</a> that there is a checkbox for enabling WEP. Most installations require that the WEP key be entered manually. Notice that this adapter does not allow you to specify the length of the WEP key, so it is the 64-bit version. Note that some vendors have configuration utilities that allow wireless NIC configuration instead of the normal right-clicking the wireless NIC and selecting <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">WEP can be hacked. With special software on a laptop that has a wireless NIC installed, WEP can be compromised. Enabling WEP is better than using no encryption whatsoever. However, an improvement on WEP is <strong><a id="ch15term36" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1098" class="pd_blue">WPA</a></strong> (Wi-Fi Protected Access).

TKIP is an improvement on WEP in that the encryption keys change. Even better than TKIP is AES, which is an encryption standard with key sizes of 128-, 192-, or 256-bits. AES has been used in wireless government networks for some time. The 802.11i wireless standard specifically deals with wireless security.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch15term37" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1099" class="pd_blue">WPA2</a></strong> is an improvement that includes dynamic negotiation between the AP and the client for authentication and encryption algorithms. WPA2 is a common choice for securing wireless networks. The 802.11i standard includes RSN (Robust Security Network), which includes some features of WPA2. Third-party products can be used with some vendorsâ wireless solutions and some vendors provide extra security of their own with their NIC cards and access points. The drawback to this is that other vendorsâ products are normally incompatible.</p>

<h3 id="ch15lev1sec12"><span class="pd_blue">Default Settings</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">All wireless networks have security features. An access point is likely to come with a default password and SSID. Change both of these settings as soon as the access point is powered on. Default passwords are posted on the Internet, and a hacker could lock out access from the access point.</p>
<p class="indent">Change the access pointâs default password during installation. Do not leave it set to the default. The default passwords are well known by many others who could attempt to hack or penetrate the wireless network. Make the password a strong one. Use as many characters as feasible. Use uppercase and lowercase letters. Include non-alphanumeric characters, such as #, %, &amp;, or @.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_848"></a>As mentioned previously, the SSID (service set identifier) is used to allow wireless devices to attach to the access point or to another wireless device. Almost all access points are configured for SSID broadcasting. <strong><a id="ch15term29" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0939" class="pd_blue">SSID broadcasting</a></strong> is where the access point periodically sends out a beacon frame that includes the SSID.

<h3 id="ch15lev1sec14"><span class="pd_blue">Wireless Security Conclusion</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Wireless security is an important issue. The following list recaps some of the important issues and provides recommendations along with a few suggestions for a more secure wireless network:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Change the default SSID and password. Make the password as long as possible and include non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Enable encryption on the access point to the highest level possible and still allow wireless NIC access. Use authentication when possible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Put the wireless network on its own subnetwork and place it behind a firewall if possible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_849"></a>â¢ If provided, enable MAC authentication (MAC filtering) on the access point. MAC authentication allows you to input valid MAC addresses that are allowed to associate to the access point. Even though time consuming, it is a good feature for small wireless networks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If supported, authenticate using an authentication server.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If the SSID is manually configured, periodically change the SSID.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Assign a static IP address to the access point rather than using DHCP for it.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disable remote management of the access point.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Place the access point in the center of the wireless network and not next to an outside window.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use wireless network scanning software to test the network security.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Require that wireless clients use a VPN (virtual private network) tunnel to access the access point.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a rogue access point (an unauthorized AP) is found on the network, disconnect the device and confiscate it. Try and determine who owns the device and report them.</p>
<p class="indent">Wireless networks have a strong presence today and will continue to do so in the future. The 802.1x and 802.11 standards are constantly being improved to tighten security for wireless networks so that they rival wired solutions.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec15"><span class="pd_blue">Wireless Network Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Troubleshooting wireless networks is sometimes easier than troubleshooting wired networks because of the mobility factor. A laptop with a wireless NIC installed can be used to troubleshoot connectivity, configuration, security, and so on. Most wireless network problems stem from inconsistent configuration. The standards deployed must be for the lowest common denominator. For example, if a wireless NIC supports only 64-bit WEP encryption, then that must be what is used even if 128-bit WEP, WPA, or WPA2 is available on some of the cards.</p>
<p class="indent">The list that follows are some general wireless networking tips designed to get a technician going in the right direction. Most of these tips have been discussed in previous sections, but it is nice to have the following troubleshooting list in one spot:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the SSID correct?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the wireless NIC seen by the operating system? (Use <em>Device Manager</em> to check.) Check the mobile device for a wireless disable button or use a <span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/fn.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="20"></span> key to disable/enable the wireless NIC.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the correct security level enabled? If WEP, is the WEP key correctly configured? Is the WEP key length correct?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the correct security key being used? Check the configuration.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Can any devices attach to the access point? If not, check the access point.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is anything causing interference or attenuation? Check antenna placement.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is there a channel ID overlap problem?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a manufacturerâs utility is being used and Windows XP is installed, does the <em>Network Properties</em> window have the <em>Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings</em> checkbox unchecked? If not, uncheck this checkbox to allow the utility to configure the wireless NIC. For Vista or 7, automatic wireless network configuration is enabled by default. A program from the wireless NIC manufacturer can be installed and used instead. If the customer wants to use Windows Vista or 7 instead of the software provided, click <em>Start</em> &gt; <em>All Programs</em> &gt; <em>Accessories</em> locate and right-click on <em>Command Prompt</em> &gt; <em>Run as administrator</em>. At the prompt, type <code>netsh wlan show</code> settings. From the output, determine whether the Windows automatic wireless configuration is disabled. You may have to disable the wireless NIC and uninstall the vendor software in order to use Windows to control the NIC.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec16"><a id="page_850"></a><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Security</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many of the issues for wireless connectivity for laptops also apply to smartphones and tablets. But smartphones and tablets have issues of their own (see <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch15.html#ch15fig32">Figure 15.32</a>).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch15fig32"></a><img src="./Chapter 15. Computer and Network Security_files/15fig32.jpg" alt="Image" width="800" height="621"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 15.32.</span> Mobile security</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Many think that because the devices do not have hard drives, they do not need antivirus software. This is a misconception. Install antivirus software on mobile devices where possible. Depending on the device, the antivirus software may not be able to automatically scan for viruses or even have a set scheduled scan time.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Mobile devices can run each app in a sandboxâa separated space from other apps. This behavior provides a natural security mechanism for applications.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Mobile device OS upgrades and updates are just as important as updates on a full-sized computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Many mobile devices have GPS tracking capability that can be used to locate a lost or stolen phone. This may be a paid service.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A paid service or an app on the phone can provide the ability to perform a remote lock or a remote wipe. The remote lock disables the phone so it cannot be accessed. The remote wipe deletes all data from the device.</p>
<p class="indent">Most mobile devices have the ability to have a PIN, security pattern, face recognition unlock, or password enabled that activates when the device is inactive. If forgotten on an iOS device, you must recover the iOS using iTunes. For an Android device, some devices support entering the Gmail account information; check the Web for recovery procedures. To configure basic mobile security, perform the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ For an Android device, select Settings &gt; <em>Location &amp; Security</em> &gt; <em>Set</em> up screen lock.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ On an iOS device, use the <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Passcode lock On</em> option. You can also configure the <em>Auto-Lock</em> time. On an iPad, you can use the <em>iPad Cover Lock/Unlock On</em> option.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_851"></a>Some mobile devices have configuration settings for what happens if the security method fails, such as an incorrectly entered password. Some devices have a default value. For an extra security precaution, some devices can be configured for what happens to the device after a set number of failed attempts, such as disabling the device or even erasing the data. Most mobile device users that have this ability enabled have the data backed up to the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec17"><span class="pd_blue">A Final Word About Security</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whether wired or wireless, standalone PC or networked PC, or full desktop computer or smartphone, data and device security are important. Security measures must always be taken. Technicians must be aware of the latest threats, take proactive measures to implement security, and must share their knowledge with users so the users can take proactive steps. Security risks and threats cause technicians a lot of work and time. These threats and attacks cost billions in lost data and time to businesses. Because most technicians do not see themselves as a dollar figure on a spreadsheet, they donât realize that if the business loses money as a result of security threats, that the business has to cut costs, and one of those costs could be the technical position. Think about it and be proactive in guarding against security threats.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec18"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâBuilding Customer Trust</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It is fitting in the security chapter to discuss building a trust relationship with the customer. Trust begins with professionalism. Be professional in your attire, attitude, written communication, and oral communication. Trust also includes being honest with the customer. If you are going to be late, let the customer know that. If you need to do more research, explain the situation. No one can be expected to know all technical information.</p>
<p class="indent">Trust also involves being honest if you find confidential material. Do not use or discuss any material you see while in a customer area. If you see confidential material, let the customer know you have seen the material. If the material is a password, let them know and recommend that they change the password immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not touch or move things or papers in a customer area. Always ask the customer to move or put things away to clear the area you need. Do not try to work around a mess. Simply explain that you will need space in order to determine and/or repair the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Trust involves giving customers documentation related to the product just installed or replaced. Trust involves doing what you say you will do. If you say you will call back to check on the situation in the next 24 hours, do so. If you say you will drop off the documentation the following week, do that. Be true to your word.</p>
<p class="indent">Trust also involves being honest about billing. Do not overcharge customers. When presenting the customer with the invoice or work order, explain any details with patience. Do not allow them to argue with you over facts or time. Your time is valuable too.</p>
<p class="indent">You never know where you are going to meet your next boss. Every time you step into a customer area or talk to a customer, it might lead to a professional reference, a job recommendation, a job lead, or a promotion. Part of building that customer relationship is building trust. Be professional in all that you do.</p>
<h3 id="ch15lev1sec19"><a id="page_852"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A security policy guides a company in security matters. The policy defines such things as physical access, antivirus, acceptable usage of devices and data, password policies, email usage guidelines, remote access strategies, and emergency procedures.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Physical security can include door access, key control, authentication methods including the use of smart cards, key fobs, RFID, biometric devices, physical protection of network devices such as servers, APs, switches, and routers, as well as privacy filters.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ BIOS security options include configuring a supervisor/user password, disabling unused ports, disabling USB ports, and disabling device options.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ To protect the operating system, use NTFS, and have a plan for updating the operating system, web browser, antivirus, antimalware, and antispyware. Encrypt files and folders as necessary. Use BitLocker and TPM technologies, implement a firewall, and disable AutoRun.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If a computer with sensitive data on the hard drive is to be donated, moved, or sold, perform the following: (1) secure erasing, (2) degaussing, and (3) drilling through drive platters and then destroying the pieces with a hammer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If virtualization is used, ensure that each virtual machine has adequate protection (firewall, antivirus, antimalware, and antispyware).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ ome virus or malware files are quarantined and must be manually deleted.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The Windows guest account should be disabled; the administrator account should have be renamed and have a strong password. User accounts provide the amount of administration dictated by what the person needs (principle of least privilege).</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Permissions should be assigned appropriately to remotely accessed files and folders. Use either share permissions or NTFS permissions (for more control), but not both on the same network share. If a file is placed in a folder that has permissions, the file inherits the folder permissions. Effective permissions are the bottom line permissions someone has when group permissions and individual permissions have been granted.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A hijacked browser can cause a different home page to appear, a particular web page to be displayed, a rootkit or other malware to be installed, different DNS settings to be applied, or a new or updated HOSTS file applied.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Email applications now protect against spam, but you can also create rules to block messages from a particular source or subject line.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Cookies store typed information including sign-ons, sites visited, passwords, and data entered through the web browser.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Internet Explorer can be customized to various levels of alerts and protection.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When a security incident occurs, identify the issue, report it through the proper channels and to the appropriate authorities, and preserve the data by using a chain-of-custody form.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ On a wireless network, implement encryption and authentication. Change default SSIDs and passwords.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Secure a mobile device with a PIN, facial recognition, a password, or a passcode/pattern. Secure important data using remote backups to the cloud. Remote data wiping can be configured if the device is compromised or stolen.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When dealing with a customer, a co-worker, or your boss, maintain your professionalism and do everything you can to build trust.</p>

<h4 id="ch15lev2sec1">Lab 15.1 Encrypting a File and Folder</h4>
<p class="objective"><em>Objective</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide security for a particular file and folder, enable encryption using Windows XP, Vista, or 7</p>
<p class="part"><em>Parts</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer with Windows XP/Vista/7 loaded with at least one NTFS partition</p>
<p class="note1"><em>Note</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two user accounts are needed and possibly created for this exerciseâone that encrypts a file and the other account to test the encryption. If two user accounts are not available, most of the lab can still be performed or a second user account can be added. This lab is best demonstrated with two accounts that have local administrator rights.</p>
<p class="procedure"><em>Procedure</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the following procedure and answer the accompanying questions.</p>
<p class="question"><a id="page_855"></a><strong>1.</strong> Power on the computer and log on using the user ID and password provided by the instructor or lab assistant.</p>
