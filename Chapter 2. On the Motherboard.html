<h3 id="ch02lev1sec1"><a id="page_46"></a><span class="pd_blue">Processor Overview</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">At the heart of every computer is a special motherboard chip called the <strong><a id="ch02term51" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0766" class="pd_blue">processor</a></strong>, which determines, to a great extent, the power of the computer. The processor is also called the CPU (central processing unit) or microprocessor. The processor executes instructions, performs calculations, and coordinates input/output operations. Each motherboard has electronic chips that work with the CPU and are designed to exact specifications. Whether these other electronic components can keep up with the processor depends on the individual componentâs specifications. The major processor manufacturers today are Intel, Motorola, VIA, Samsung, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.). Intel and AMD are the predominant manufacturers for desktop and laptop processors, and the other manufacturers target the mobile/smartphone markets.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec2"><span class="pd_blue">Processor Basics</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">All processors use 1s and 0s. One 1 or one 0 is a <strong><a id="ch02term07" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0082" class="pd_blue">bit</a></strong>.

To a processor, the letter A looks like 01000001. Each character on a keyboard appears as 1 byte or 8 bits to the processor.

Approximately 1 million bytes is a <strong><a id="ch02term39" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0572" class="pd_blue">megabyte</a></strong> (MB), but a true megabyte is 1,048,576 bytes. 540 megabytes is shown as 540MB, or 540M. Approximately 1 billion bytes (1,073,741,824 bytes) is a <strong><a id="ch02term24" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0410" class="pd_blue">gigabyte</a></strong> and is shown as 1GB or 1G.</p>
<p class="indent">When information needs to be expressed exactly, binary prefixes are used. For example, when describing a value of 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024), instead of saying that it is 1 kilobyte, which people tend to think of as approximately 1,000 bytes, the term kibibyte (KiB) is used. When describing a value of 2<sup>20</sup>, or 1,048,576, the term mebibyte (MiB) is used. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02tab01">Table 2.1</a> shows the terms used with computer storage capacity and binary prefixes when exact measurements are needed.</p>

<p class="indent">Processors come in a variety of speeds, measured in <strong><a id="ch02term25" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0411" class="pd_blue">gigahertz</a></strong> (GHz). Hertz is a measurement of cycles per second. One hertz equals one cycle per second. One gigahertz is 1 billion cycles per second, or 1GHz. The original PC CPU, the 8088 microprocessor, ran at 4.77MHz. Todayâs processors run at speeds over 3GHz.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_47"></a>The number of bits processed at one time is the processorâs register size (word size). Intelâs 8086 processorâs register size was 16 bits, or 2 bytes. Todayâs CPUs have register sizes of 64 or 128 bits.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1s and 0s must travel from one place to another inside the processor, as well as outside to other chips. To move the 1s and 0s around, electronic lines called a <strong><a id="ch02term08" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0104" class="pd_blue">bus</a></strong> are used. The electronic lines inside the CPU are known as the <strong><a id="ch02term32" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0491" class="pd_blue">internal data bus</a></strong> or system bus. In the 8086 the internal data bus comprises 16 separate lines, with each line carrying one 1 or one 0. The word size and the number of lines for the internal data bus are equal. The 8086, for example, had a 16-bit word size, and 16 lines carried 16 bits on the internal data bus. In todayâs processors, 64 or 128 internal data bus lines operate concurrently.</p>
<p class="indent">For a CPU to communicate with devices in the outside world, such as a printer, the 1s and 0s travel on the <strong><a id="ch02term21" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0350" class="pd_blue">external data bus</a></strong>. The external data bus connects the processor to adapters, the keyboard, the mouse, the hard drive, and other devices. An external data bus is also known as an external data path. You can see the external data lines by looking between the expansion slots on the motherboard. Some solder lines between the expansion slots are used to send data out along the external data bus to the expansion slots. Todayâs processors have 64- and 128-bit external data paths. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig01">Figure 2.1</a> shows the internal and external data buses.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.1.</span> Internal and external data buses</p>
<p class="indent">A processor has a special component called the ALU (arithmetic logic unit), which does all the calculations and comparison logic that the computer needs. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig01">Figure 2.1</a> shows the basic concept of how the ALU connects to the registers, control unit, and internal bus. The control unit coordinates activities inside the processor. The I/O unit manages data entering and leaving the processor. The registers within the CPU are a very high-speed storage area for 1s and 0s before the bits are processed.</p>
<p class="indent">To make sense of all of this, take a look at a letter typed on a computer that starts out <em>Dear Mom</em>. To the computer, each letter of the alphabet is a different combination of eight 1s and 0s. For example, the letter <em>D</em> is 01000100, and the letter <em>e</em> is 01000101. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig02">Figure 2.2</a> demonstrates that the size of the bus greatly increases performance on a computer similar to the way that increasing the number of lanes of highway decreases congestion.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_48"></a><a id="ch02fig02"></a><img src="./Chapter 2. On the Motherboard_files/02fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="660" height="400"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.2.</span> Bus performance</p>
<p class="indent">Processors have multiple pipelines (separate internal buses) that operate simultaneously. To understand pipelining, take the example of a fast-food restaurant. In the restaurant, say that there are five steps (and one employee per step) involved in making a burger and giving it to the customer: (1) Take the order and input it into the computer system; (2) brown the buns and cook the burgers; (3) add the condiments to the bun and burger; (4) wrap the burger add fries and insert them into the bag; (5) take the customerâs money and give the bag to the customer. Keep in mind that the person taking the customerâs order and inputting the order can serve another customer once he or she has completed this task for the first customer. The same is true for each person along the line. To make this burger process go faster, you could: (1) Make your employees work faster; (2) break the tasks into smaller tasks (such as seven steps instead of five and have seven people); or (3) have more lines of people doing exactly the same process tasks.</p>
<p class="indent">To relate this to processors, making the employees work faster is the same as increasing the CPU clock speed. Breaking the tasks into smaller tasks is the same as changing the structure of the CPU pipeline. Instead of performing the standard 5 tasks, the CPU might perform 6, 7, 14, 20, or even more steps. This allows each step to be acted upon more quickly, the task to be smaller, and production to be faster. Having more lines of people doing the same complete process is like having multiple pipelines.</p>
<p class="indent">A 32- or 64-bit CPU can have separate paths, each of which handles 32 or 64 bits. For example, if a processor has two pipelines, the Dear Mom letter can be in one pipeline, while a photo upload using a different application can be in the other pipeline.</p>
<p class="indent">A processor might have 12 pipelines for integers and 17 pipelines for floating-point numbers. (A floating-point number is a number that can include a decimal point.) Other processors contain anywhere from 20- to 31-stage pipelines. Debate continues about whether a longer pipeline improves performance.</p>

A processor commonly does not use its maximum speed in order to save power or stay cool.</p>

<p class="indent">We have already taken a look at how increasing the CPU pipeline can, to some extent, improve processor operations, but other technologies also exist. We will start by defining some of the terms that relate to this area and associating those terms with concepts and the various technologies used. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02tab04">Table 2.4</a> list some terms related to speed.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec6"><span class="pd_blue">Cache</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">An important concept related to processor speed is keeping data flowing into the processor. Registers are a type of high-speed memory storage inside the processor. They are used to temporarily hold calculations, data, or instructions. The data or instruction the CPU needs to operate on is usually found in one of three places: the cache, the motherboard memory (main memory), or the hard drive.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a id="ch02term11" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0116" class="pd_blue">Cache memory</a></strong> is a very fast type of memory designed to increase the speed of processor operations. When cache memory is integrated as part of the processor, it is called <strong><a id="ch02term34" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0523" class="pd_blue">L1 cache</a></strong>. Included in the processor packaging, but not part of the CPU, is <strong><a id="ch02term35" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0524" class="pd_blue">L2 cache</a></strong>, which some refer to as on-die cache. Finally, a third level of memory is found when using higher-end computer processors; it is called <strong><a id="ch02term36" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0525" class="pd_blue">L3 cache</a></strong> and can be located in the CPU housing or on the motherboard. CPU efficiency is increased when data continuously flows into the CPU. Cache provides the fastest access. If the information is not in cache, the processor looks for the data in motherboard RAM. If the information is not there, it is retrieved from the hard drive and placed into the motherboard memory or the cache. Hard drive access is the slowest of the three.</p>
<p class="indent">An analogy best explains this. Consider a glass of cold lemonade, a pitcher of lemonade, and a can of frozen lemonade concentrate. If you were thirsty, you would drink from the glass because it is the fastest and most easily accessible. If the glass were empty, you would pour lemonade from the pitcher to refill the glass. If the pitcher were empty, you would go to the freezer to get the frozen concentrate to make more. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig05">Figure 2.5</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.5.</span> CPU data sources</p>
<p class="indent">Usually, the more cache memory a system has, the better that system performs, but this is not always true. System performance also depends on the efficiency of the cache controller (the chip that manages the cache memory), the system design, the amount of available hard drive space, and the speed of the processor. When determining memory requirements, you must consider the operating system used, applications used, and hardware installed. The Windows XP operating system takes a lot less memory than Windows 7. High-end games and desktop publishing take more RAM than word processing. Free hard drive space and video memory are often as important as RAM in improving a computerâs performance. Memory is only one piece of the puzzle. All of the computerâs parts must work together to provide good system performance. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig06">Figure 2.6</a> shows this hierarchy of data access for the CPU.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec7"><span class="pd_blue">Clocking</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The motherboard generates a clock signal that is used to control the transfer of 1s and 0s to and from the processor. A clock signal can be illustrated as a sine wave. One clock cycle is from one point on the sine wave to the next point that is located on the same point on the sine wave later in time, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig07">Figure 2.7</a>.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.7.</span> Clock cycle</p>
<p class="indent">In older computers, data was sent to the CPU only once during a clock cycle. Then, newer memory technologies evolved that allow data to be sent twice during every clock cycle. Today, data is sent four times during a single clock cycle, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig08">Figure 2.8</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec8"><a id="page_54"></a><span class="pd_blue">Threading Technology</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Several threading techniques are used to speed up processor efficiency: multithreading and HT (Hyper-Threading Technology). A <strong><a id="ch02term54" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0992" class="pd_blue">thread</a></strong> is a small piece of an application process that can be handled by an operating system. An operating system such as Windows schedules and assigns resources to a thread. Each thread can share resources (such as the processor or cache memory) with other threads. A thread in the pipeline might have a delay due to waiting on data to be retrieved or access to a port or another hardware component. Multithreading keeps the line moving by letting another thread execute some code. This is like a grocery cashier taking another customer while someone goes for a forgotten loaf of bread. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig09">Figure 2.9</a> shows this concept.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.9.</span> Multithreading</p>
<p class="indent">Intelâs HTT (Hyper-Threading Technology, HT Technology, or simply shortened to <strong><a id="ch02term29" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0452" class="pd_blue">HT</a></strong>) allows a single processor to handle two separate sets of instructions simultaneously. To the operating system, HT makes the system appear as if it has multiple processors. Intel claims that the system can have up to a 30 percent increase in performance, but studies have shown that the increase is application dependent. If the application being used cannot take advantage of the multithreading, then HT can be disabled in the system BIOS. System BIOS configuration is covered in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec9"><span class="pd_blue">Connecting to the Processor</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have considered various ways to speed up processor operations, including having more stages in the processor, increasing the speed of the clock, and sending more data in the same amount of time. Accessing L2 cache and motherboard components was a bottleneck in older systems because the CPU used the same bus to communicate with RAM and other motherboard components as it did with L2 and motherboard cache. The solution is DIB (dual independent bus). With DIB, two buses are used: a back side bus and a front side bus. The back side bus connects the CPU to the L2 cache. The FSB (front side bus) connects the CPU to the motherboard components. The FSB is considered the speed of the motherboard. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig10">Figure 2.10</a> illustrates the concept of a front side bus. Remember that the front side bus is more detailed than what is shown; the figure simply illustrates the difference between the back side bus and the front side bus.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig10"></a><img src="./Chapter 2. On the Motherboard_files/02fig10.jpg" alt="Image" width="655" height="241"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.10.</span> Front side bus</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_55"></a>Many people think that the higher the CPU speed, the faster the computer. This is seldom true. Several factors contribute to computer speed. One factor is bus speed. Bus speed describes how fast the CPU can communicate with motherboard components, such as memory, the chipset, or the PCI/PCIe bus. The first Pentium CPUs ran at the same speed as the bus (60MHz); in time, CPUs got faster and buses stayed the same. Advances in technology have not reached the rest of the motherboard components (and it would cost too much to try to have them keep pace).</p>
<p class="indent">Intel and AMD have technologies to replace the front side bus in some parts. AMDâs solution is Direct Connect. Direct Connect allows each of the processor cores to connect directly to memory, to the other motherboard components such as the expansion slots, and to other processor cores, using a high-speed bus called <strong><a id="ch02term30" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0461" class="pd_blue">HyperTransport</a></strong>. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig12">Figure 2.12</a>, later in this chapter, shows HyperTransport connectivity. Intel has QPI (QuickPath Interconnect) and DMI (Direct Media Interface), which are full-duplex (that is, traffic can flow in both directions simultaneously) point-to-point connections between the processor and one or more motherboard components. This type of connectivity is shown later in the chapter, in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig39">Figure 2.39</a>.</p>

<p class="notepara">When installing a processor, two BIOS settings can be important: CPU bus frequency and bus frequency multiple. The CPU bus frequency setting allows the motherboard to run at a specific speed. This speed is the external rate at which data travels <em>outside</em> the processor. The bus frequency multiple enables the motherboard to recognize the <em>internal</em> processor speed.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Motherboard speed in recent times has been confusing. A multiplier is a number that, when multiplied by the front side bus speed, determines the CPU speed. Other names for the multiplier include CPU clock ratio, stepping value, bus frequency multiple, and bus frequency ratio. If the motherboard is using a 300MHz base clock frequency and the CPU multiplier is set to 9, then the speed of the CPU is 2.7GHz. Multipliers can be shown in .5 increments as well. The available multiplier and the bus speed are determined by the motherboard manufacturer.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing the CPU speed is no longer an issue unless you are upgrading a computer to a faster processor or configuring the motherboard. Many motherboards accept processors with different speeds. The processor settings are static (cannot be changed) or can be configured through system BIOS, which is covered in more detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another bottleneck for computer performance is video. Computer users who want better video performance buy a separate video adapter that contains a GPU. Both Intel and AMD have integrated a GPU within the CPU on some of their processor models. An external video card with a GPU is not required, and graphical data is processed quickly, with reduced power consumption.</p>

Now there are <strong><a id="ch02term27" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0435" class="pd_blue">hexa-core</a></strong> (six cores) and <strong><a id="ch02term43" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0660" class="pd_blue">octa-core</a></strong> (eight cores) processors, as well. IT professionals in the field find it easiest to just say <em>multi-core</em> to describe the multiple cores contained in the same processor housing.</p>
<p class="indent">Single-core processors and early dual-core processors accessed memory through a memory controller, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig11">Figure 2.11</a>. Today, the processor cores have their own memory controller built into the processor. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig12">Figure 2.12</a> shows how an AMD quad-core processor has an integrated controller and interfaces with the rest of the motherboard using a high-speed bus called HyperTransport. HyperTransport is a feature of AMDâs Direct Connect architecture. With Direct Connect, there are no front side buses. Instead, the memory controller and input/output functions directly connect to the CPU.</p>

<p class="indent">In the past, dual processors were most beneficial in servers and gaming PCs, where software was written for and could take advantage of two-processor technology. Today, multi-core processors are useful to anyone. All applications can take advantage of the multi-core technology as well as the background processes that are associated with the operating system and applications. This improves operations when multitasking or when running powerful applications that require many instructions to be executed, such as drawing applications and games.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_57"></a>One advantage of having multiple processor cores is that home and business computers can take advantage of virtualization. <strong><a id="ch02term56" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1059" class="pd_blue">Virtualization</a></strong> is having one or two virtual machines on the same computer. Virtualization software such as VMware Workstation or Microsoft Hyper-V allows one computer to act as if it were two or more computers. The computer could have two or more operating systems installed through the use of the virtualization software. Each operating system would have no knowledge of the other operating system. Windows 7 has Virtual PC, which allows an application to run within a virtual environment as if an older operating system were installed. The concept of virtualization is of interest to businesses so that legacy software can be put on a newer machine but kept separate from the main operating system or another virtualized machine on the same computer. Reduced costs and physical space are benefits of virtualization. Home computer users can install multiple operating systems in separate VMs (virtual machines) within the same physical box, with each VM being seen as a separate computer.</p>
<p class="indent">If the host computer had eight processor cores, these cores could all be allocated to each virtual machine. The cores could also be allocated evenly or unevenly between the VMs. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig13">Figure 2.13</a> illustrates this concept.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig13"></a><img src="./Chapter 2. On the Motherboard_files/02fig13.jpg" alt="Image" width="652" height="345"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.13.</span> The concept of virtualization</p>
<p class="indent">Selecting a motherboard and processor is important when in a virtual environment. Not all processors were designed for virtualization. Refer to the virtualization software documentation to determine if the CPU being used is allowed to be used in a virtual environment. Another issue regarding processors and virtualization is licensing. For virtualization software that must be purchased (that is, is not freeware), the software manufacturer can charge on a per-processor or per-socket license basis or a per-core basis. If a CPU has four cores, then pricing might play into what virtualization software is purchased.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec11"><span class="pd_blue">Sockets and Slots</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A processor inserts into a socket or slot, depending on the model. Most processors today insert into a socket. There are different types of sockets: PGA (pin grid array), which has even rows of holes around a square socket; SPGA (staggered pin array), which has staggered holes so more pins can be inserted; PPGA (plastic pin grid array); Î¼PGA (micro pin grid array); FCBGA (flip chip ball grid array); and LGA (land grid array) are all used with either AMD and/or Intel processors. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig14">Figure 2.14</a> shows an LGA775 socket.</p>

<p class="indent">Processor sockets are also called <strong><a id="ch02term57" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_1113" class="pd_blue">ZIF</a></strong> (zero insertion force) <span class="pd_blue"><strong>sockets</strong></span>; they come in different sizes. A processor socket accepts one or more specific processor models. The socket has a small lever to the side that, when lifted, brings the processor slightly up and out of the socket holes. When installing a processor, the CPU is aligned over the holes and the lever is depressed to bring the processor pins into the slot with equal force on all the pins. In <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig14">Figure 2.14</a>, notice the lever beside the socket.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec12"><a id="page_59"></a><span class="pd_blue">Processor Cooling</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Keeping the CPU cool is very important. Both Intel and AMD have technologies that reduce processor energy consumption (and heat) by turning off unused parts of the processor or slowing down the processor when it starts to overheat. But these measures alone are not enough. Todayâs systems use fans and heat sinks. A heat sink looks like metal bars or fins protruding from the processor. The largest chip or cartridge on or inserted into the motherboard with a fan or a heat sink attached is easily recognized as the processor. Some systems have multiple fans to keep the CPU cool. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig15">Figure 2.15</a> shows a fan and a heat sink.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig15"></a><img src="./Chapter 2. On the Motherboard_files/02fig15.jpg" alt="Image" width="633" height="420"></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.15.</span> A CPU fan and heat sink</p>
<p class="indent">CPU fans frequently have a 3- or 4-pin cable that attaches to the motherboard. The motherboard might have a 3- or 4-pin connector. A 3-pin fan can be attached to a 4-pin motherboard connector, and a 4-pin fan cable can be connected to a 3-pin motherboard connector, as shown in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig16">Figure 2.16</a>. Note that when a 3-pin cable attaches to 4-pin connector, the fan is always on and cannot be controlled, like a 4-pin cable to 4-pin connector can.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.16.</span> CPU fan connectivity</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_60"></a>Additional motherboard components can also have heat sinks attached. These are normally the chipset and/or the I/O (input/output) controller chips. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig17">Figure 2.17</a> shows a motherboard with these cooling elements.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.17.</span> Motherboard heat sinks</p>
<p class="indent">Heat sinks and fans attach to the processor using different methods. The most common methods are screws, thermal compound, and clips. Clips can use retaining screws, pressure release (where you press down on them, and they release), or a retaining slot. Small screwdrivers can be used to release the clips that attach using the retaining slot. Clips for fans or heat sinks can be difficult to install. The type of heat sink and/or fan installed must fit the processor and case.</p>
<p class="indent">When installing a heat sink, a thermal pad or thermal paste/compound may be used. A thermal pad provides uniform heat dispersion for the CPU. Thermal paste, compound, or grease is a substance applied to the top of the processor before a heat sink is attached. The thermal paste further reduces heat generated by the processor. If thermal paste is used, you should apply the prescribed amount. Spread the compound evenly in a fine layer over the portion of the CPU that comes in contact with the heat sink. Always follow the heat sink installation directions.</p>

<p class="notepara">Over time, thermal paste can act like glue, making the processor hard to separate from the heat sink. You can use a thermal paste cleaner, acetone, or denatured alcohol to separate the two parts. Do not pry!</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Some heat sinks are known as active heat sinks. These have power provided by a motherboard connection or through one of the power supply drive connectors. Some motherboards come with sensors that monitor CPU temperatures, motherboard temperatures, and fan speed. The BIOS can be used to configure the CPU. Additional fans can be installed to provide additional cooling for the PC. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig18">Figure 2.18</a> shows extra cooling fans mounted in a case.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.18.</span> Computer case auxiliary fans</p>
<p class="indent">Because heat sinks generate a lot of heat, it is important to have the proper amount of airflow in the right direction. If you install an additional fan to help with cooling, there are two likely places for fan placement: (1) near the power supply directly behind the CPU, and (2) on the lower-front part of the case. Different cases have different numbers and locations of possible mounting spots for the case fan(s). <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig19">Figure 2.19</a> shows two possible installation sites for an additional fan.</p>

With a liquid cooling system, liquid is circulated through the system, including through a heat sink that is mounted on the CPU. Heat from the processor is transferred to the cooler liquid. The now-hot liquid is transported to the back of the system, converted to heat, and released outside the case.</p>

<p class="notepara">Air flow should be through the computer and over the motherboard to provide cooling for the motherboard components.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Liquid cooling allows higher clock speeds and is quieter than using a fan. However, some liquid cooling systems are difficult to install and require space within the case. Some liquid systems require the liquid to be periodically refilled. The good part about a liquid cooling system is that the CPU temperature remains constant, no matter how much usage the CPU is experiencing. This is not the case with heat sinks and fans. A similar but expensive cooling technology is phase-change cooling (also known as vapor cooling). Phase-change cooling uses a technique similar to a refrigerator: A gas is converted to a liquid that is converted back to gas.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec13"><span class="pd_blue">Installing Processors</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Processors are sold with installation instructions. Also, motherboard manuals (documentation) include the steps to upgrade or install the CPU. The following are the general steps for installing a processor:</p>

<p class="title"><span class="middle"><img src="./Chapter 2. On the Motherboard_files/tip.jpg" alt="Image" width="36" height="46"></span> <span class="pd_blue">Tech Tip: Handling the CPU</span></p>
<p class="notepara">Always hold the CPU by the edges to avoid bending or touching the pins underneath. Do not lay the CPU down on a flat surface because the pins can easily bend.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="part"><em>Parts</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper processor for the motherboard (refer to motherboard documentation) Antistatic materials</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Ensure that power to the computer is off and the computer is unplugged.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Place an antistatic wrist strap around your wrist and attach the other end to a ground or unpainted metal part of the computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Remove the old processor by lifting the ZIF socket retaining lever and gently removing the processor.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Insert the new CPU into the socket. When installing a CPU, it fits only one way into the socket. Look at the processor and the socket before inserting the chip to ensure proper alignment. A socket and CPU normally have a triangle marking or circular dot that shows where pin 1 goes. Processors insert only one way into the socket. If the socket has a retention lever, raising the socket lever allows a CPU to be inserted. Lowering the lever keeps the CPU inserted into the socket. Some motherboards have a retention mechanism used with processors equipped with mounted heat sinks.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Normally, you might be required to configure the motherboard by using jumpers or through BIOS software configuration. Refer to the motherboard manual for exact steps.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><span class="pd_blue">Figure 2.20.</span> Installing a CPU</p>
<p class="indent">Two common questions asked of technicians are âCan a computer be upgraded to a higher or faster processor?â and âShould a computer be upgraded to a higher or faster processor?â Whether or not a computer can be upgraded to a higher or faster processor depends on the capability of the motherboard. When a customer asks if a processor should be upgraded, the technician should ask, âWhat operating system and applications are you using?â The newer the operating system, the more advanced a processor should be. Some games and applications that must perform calculations, as well as graphic-oriented applications, require a faster, more advanced processor.</p>
<p class="indent">When installing multiple processors, some motherboards require that the same processor model be used in each slot. This is not always true with newer motherboards. Refer to the motherboard documentation. The motherboardâs documentation is very important when considering a CPU upgrade. Read the documentation to determine whether the motherboard can accept a faster processor.</p>
<p class="indent">When upgrading a CPU on an older or newer system, an important consideration is CPU voltage. Different CPUs require different voltage levels. Inserting a CPU into a socket that has a lower or higher voltage supplied to it will damage the new CPU. A VRM (voltage regulator module) is integrated into the motherboard and can provide the appropriate voltage. The CPU can communicate to the VRM the voltage level desired, and the VRM can provide it. Running a processor at lower speeds and lower voltages can save on power consumption, especially on a mobile platform.</p>

Usually this feature is controlled by a system BIOS setting and the Windows <em>Power Options</em> Control Panel. Some users may not want to use CPU throttling so that performance is at a maximum. Others, such as laptop users, may want to conserve power whenever possible to extend the time the laptop can be used on battery power.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_64"></a>Upgrading components other than the processor can also increase speed in a computer. Installing more memory, a faster hard drive, or a motherboard with a faster front side bus sometimes improves a computerâs performance more than installing a new processor. All devices and electronic components must work together, transferring the 1s and 0s efficiently. The processor is only one piece of the puzzle. Many people do not realize that upgrading one computer component does not always make a computer faster or better.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec14"><span class="pd_blue">Mobile Device Motherboards/CPUs</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Mobile device motherboards are similar to desktop motherboards: A mobile device motherboard holds the majority of the electronics, contains a processor, has memory, and supports having ports attached. However, the processor on a mobile device is normally not as powerful as a desktop model, has less memory that may not be upgradeable, and has fewer ports. However, some powerful laptops have more power, upgradability, and ports than some low-end desktop models.</p>
<p class="indent">Laptop processors are not normally upgraded, but they do sometimes have to be replaced. Always refer to the laptop documentation for motherboard removal procedures. Always power the laptop off. Always remove the laptop battery. Use proper grounding procedures (further discussed in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">At a minimum, screws from the underside of the laptop have to be removed. Sometimes, hard drives, drives that insert on the side of the laptop, and memory must be removed before you can remove the motherboard. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig21">Figure 2.21</a> shows the underside of a laptop and how you might have to remove screws to get these parts out before you can remove the motherboard.</p>

Before describing the overclocking steps, we must discuss the following related issues:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Because the CPU is normally covered with a heat sink and/or fan, you cannot easily tell the CPU speed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ CPU speed ratings are conservative.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The CPU, motherboard, memory, and other components can be damaged by overclocking.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Applications may crash, the operating system may not boot, and/or the system may hang when overclocking.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The warranty is void on most CPUs if you overclock.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When you increase the speed of the CPU, the processorâs heat increases. Extra cooling, using fans and larger heat sinks, is essential.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Devices may not react well to overclocking.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The memory chips may need to be upgraded to be able to keep up with the faster CPU.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ You need to know how to reset the system BIOS in case the computer will not boot properly after you make changes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_66"></a>Many motherboard manufacturers do not allow changes to the CPU, multiplier, and clock settings. The changes to the motherboard are most often made through the BIOS setup. However, CPU manufacturers may provide tuning tools in the form of applications installed on the computer for overclocking configuration. Keep in mind that overclocking is a trial-and-error situation. The primary problem with overclocking is insufficient cooling. Make sure you purchase a larger heat sink and/or extra fans before starting the overclocking process. There are websites geared toward documenting specific motherboards and overclocked CPUs.</p>

An expansion slot is used to add an adapter to the motherboard, and it has rules that control how many bits can be transferred at a time to the adapter, what signals are sent over the adapterâs gold connectors, and how the adapter is configured. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig24">Figure 2.24</a> shows expansion slots on a motherboard.</p>

<p class="indent">Expansion slots used in PCs are usually some form of PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect), AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port), or PCIe (PCI Express). Other types of expansion slots that have been included with older PCs are ISA (Industry Standard Architecture), EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture), MCA (Micro Channel Architecture), and VL-bus (sometimes called VESA [video electronics standards association] bus). A technician must be able to distinguish among adapters and expansion slots and be able to identify the adapters/devices that use an expansion slot. A technician must also realize the abilities and limitations of each type of expansion slot when installing upgrades, replacing parts, and making recommendations.</p>

Intel provided the majority of the development for AGP, and the specification was originally designed around the Pentium II processor. AGP speeds up 3-D graphics, 3-D acceleration, and full-motion playback.</p>
<p class="indent">With AGP, the processor on the video adapter can directly access RAM on the graphics card or, when even more RAM is needed, access the memory on the motherboard. This helps with video-intensive applications, such as 3-D graphics, which are resource intensive and use a lot of memory. Software developers can produce better and faster 3-D graphics by using AGP technology. The best performance is achieved when applications use the RAM on the AGP adapter. Previous video adapters were limited by the bottleneck caused by going through an adapter and a bus shared with other devices. With AGP, the video subsystem is isolated from the rest of the computer. The different versions of AGP are known as 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02tab06">Table 2.6</a> summarizes the differences between the AGP versions.</p>

<p class="notepara">Older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP adapters will not work in any type of PCIe slots.</p>
<hr></div>
<p class="indent">The older PCI standards, including PCI-X, use a parallel bus where data is sent with multiple 1s and 0s simultaneously. PCIe is a serial bus, and data is sent one bit at a time. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02tab08">Table 2.8</a> shows a comparison of the PCI, PCI-X, AGP, and PCIe buses. Another difference between PCI and PCIe is that PCIe slots come in different versions, depending on the maximum number of lanes that can be assigned to the card inserted into the slot. For example, an x1 slot can have only one transfer lane used by the x1 card inserted into the slot; x2, x4, x8, x16, x32 slots are also available. An x16 slot accepts up to 16 lanes, but fewer lanes can be assigned. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig31">Figure 2.31</a> shows the concepts of PCIe lanes. Notice how one lane has two unidirectional communication channels. Also note how only seven lanes are used. PCIe has the ability to use a reduced number of lanes if one lane has a failure or a performance issue.</p>

<hr></div>

<p class="noindent">Motherboards come in different sizes, known as <strong><a id="ch02term22" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0386" class="pd_blue">form factors</a></strong>. The most common motherboard form factor is ATX. The different types of ATX are known as microATX (sometimes shown as Î¼ATX), miniATX, FlexATX, EATX, WATX, nanoATX, picoATX, and mobileATX. A smaller form factor is ITX, which comes in a miniITX, nanoITX, and picoITX sizes. Some motherboards, such as the NLX and LPX form factors, had a riser board that attached to the smaller motherboard. Adapters go into the slots on the riser board instead of into motherboard slots. <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch02.html#ch02fig40">Figure 2.40</a> shows some of the motherboard form factors.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_79"></a>The BTX form factor was intended to replace ATX. But further development of the BTX standard was canceled in favor of propriety form factors. Within the BTX family of form factors are the smaller versions called microBTX (sometimes shown as Î¼BTX), nanoBTX, and picoBTX. The WTX (for Workstation Technology Extended) is an older form factor that is larger than ATX or BTX and was used with high-end workstations, such as those with multiple processors and more drives.</p>

<hr></div>
<p class="indent">Manufacturers sometimes design a case so that it requires a proprietary motherboard. With such a design, a replacement motherboard must be purchased from the original manufacturer and is usually more expensive than a generic option.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec25"><span class="pd_blue">Upgrading and Replacing Motherboards</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When upgrading a motherboard or processor, you must consider several issues. The following list guides you through making the decision (or helping a customer make the decision) of whether to upgrade a motherboard:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Why is the computer being upgraded? For example, does the computer need more memory? Are more expansion slots needed? Does the computer need a bigger/faster CPU to run certain operating systems or applications? Is more space wanted in the computer area? Sometimes upgrading the motherboard does not help unless the other computer components are upgraded. The most expensive and fastest motherboard/CPU will not run applications well unless it has the proper amount of memory. Hard drives are another issue. If software access is slow, the solution might not be a new motherboard but a faster and larger hard drive or more RAM.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_80"></a>â¢ Which type (ISA, PCI, AGP, or PCIe) and how many adapters are needed from the old motherboard? Does the new motherboard have the required expansion slots?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ What type of chipsets does the new motherboard support? What features, if any, would this bring to the new motherboard?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Will the new motherboard fit in the current computer case, or is a new one required?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ If upgrading the CPU, will the motherboard support the new type of CPU?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Does the motherboard allow for future CPU upgrades?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ How much memory (RAM) does the motherboard allow? What memory chips are required on the new motherboard? Will the old memory chips work in the new motherboard or with the new CPU?</p>
<p class="indent">Before replacing a motherboard, it is important to do all the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove the CPU and CPU fan.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove adapters from expansion slots.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove memory chips from expansion slots.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disconnect power connectors.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disconnect ribbon cables.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Disconnect external devices such as mouse, keyboard, and monitor.</p>
<p class="indent">Replacement motherboards do not normally come with RAM, so the old modules are removed from the bad/older motherboard. A motherboard usually does not come with a CPU. Make note of the CPU orientation before removing it from the bad/older motherboard. Some retailers sell kits that include the computer case, power supply, motherboard, and CPU so that the components match, function together correctly, and are physically compatible.</p>
<p class="indent">When upgrading any component or the entire computer, remember that the older part can be donated to a charity or educational institution. Something that one person considers outdated may be an upgrade to someone else. Educational institutions are always seeking components to use in classrooms. Many stores have recycling programs for computer parts.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec26"><span class="pd_blue">Motherboard Troubleshooting</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Common symptoms of motherboard issues are similar to CPU problems: The system does not display anything, an error code appears, one or more beeps occur, the system locks, the system reboots, a Windows BSOD (blue screen of death) appears, or one or more of the ports, expansion slots, or memory modules fails.</p>
<p class="indent">Motherboard problems and power problems are probably the most difficult things to troubleshoot. Because various components are located on the motherboard, many things can cause errors. <strong><a id="ch02term50" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0739" class="pd_blue">POST</a></strong> (power-on self-test) is one of the most beneficial aids for troubleshooting a motherboard. The meaning of any codes that appear on the screen should be researched. If multiple POST error codes appear, you should troubleshoot them in the order they are presented. The following list helps with motherboard troubleshooting:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Is the motherboard receiving power? Check the power supply to see if the fan is turning. If the CPU or motherboard has a fan, see if it is turning. Check voltages going from the power supply to the motherboard. See <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a> for directions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the BIOS settings (covered in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>) for accuracy.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_81"></a>â¢ Check for overheating. Power down the computer and allow the computer to cool. Power on the computer with the cover off.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Reseat the CPU, adapters, and memory chips.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Remove unnecessary adapters and devices and boot the computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Plug the computer into a different power outlet and circuit, if possible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check if the motherboard is shorting out on the frame.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Check the CMOS battery.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ With a motherboards that has diagnostic LEDs, check the output for any error code. Refer to the motherboard documentation or online documentation for the problem and possible solution.</p>

<h3 id="ch02lev1sec27"><span class="pd_blue">Soft SkillsâActive Listening</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong><a id="ch02term02" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complete-comptia-a/9780133057638/gloss01.html#gloss01_0012" class="pd_blue">Active listening</a></strong> is participating in a conversation where you focus on what the customer is sayingâin other words, listening more than talking. For a technician, active listening has the following benefits:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Allows you to gather data and symptoms quickly</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Allows you to build customer rapport</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Improves your understanding of the problem</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Allows you to solve the problem more quickly because you understand the problem better</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Provides mutual understanding between you and the customer</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Provides a means of having a positive, engaged conversation rather than having a negative, confrontational encounter</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Focuses on the customer rather than the technician</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Provides an environment where the customer might be more forthcoming with information related to the problem</p>
<p class="indent">Frequently, when a technician arrives onsite or contacts a customer who has a technical problem, the technician is (1) rushed; (2) thinking of other things, including the problems that need to be solved; (3) assuming that he or she knows exactly what the problem is, even though the user has not finished explaining the problem; or (4) more interested in the technical problem than in the customer and the issues. Active listening changes the focus from the technicianâs problems to the customerâs problems.</p>
<p class="indent">A common but ineffective service call involves a technician doing most of the talking and questioning, using technical jargon and acronyms and a flat or condescending tone. The customer, who feels vulnerable, experiences a heightened anxiety level. Active listening changes this scenario by helping you build a professional relationship with your customers. The following list outlines some measures that help you implement active listening.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Have a positive, engaged professional attitude when talking and listening to customers:</strong></p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Leave your prejudices behind; be polite and aware of other cultures and customs; be open-minded and nonjudgmental.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Have a warm and caring attitude.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not fold your arms in front of your chest because doing so distances you from the problem and the customer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not blame others or talk badly about other technicians.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_82"></a>â¢ Do not act as if the problem is not your responsibility.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Focus on what the customer is saying:</strong></p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Turn off or ignore electronic devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Maintain eye contact; donât let your mind wander.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Allow the customer to finish explaining the problem; do not interrupt; avoid arguing with the customer or being defensive.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Stop all irrelevant behaviors and activities.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Mentally review what the customer is saying.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Refrain from talking to co-workers unnecessarily while interacting with customers.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Avoid personal interruptions or distractions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Participate in the conversation in a limited, but active manner:</strong></p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Maintain a professional demeanor (suspend negative emotions); do not minimize or diminish the customerâs problem.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Acknowledge that you are listening by occasionally nodding and making comments, such as âI see.â</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Use positive body language such as leaning slightly forward or taking notes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Observe the customerâs behavior to determine when it is appropriate to ask questions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Briefly talk with the customer:</strong></p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Speak with a positive tone; use a tone that is empathetic and genuine, not condescending.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Restate or summarize points made by the customer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Ask nonthreatening, probing questions related to the customerâs statements or questions.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not jump between topics.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Do not use technical jargon.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Clarify the meaning of the customerâs situation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Identify clues to help solve the problem and reduce your troubleshooting time by listening carefully to what the customer says.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Follow up with the person at a later date to ensure that the problem is solved and to verify satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Offer different repair option or replacement options, if possible.</p>
<h3 id="ch02lev1sec28"><a id="page_83"></a><span class="pd_blue">Chapter Summary</span></h3>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Important motherboard parts include the following: processor, RAM slots/RAM, expansion slots (PCI, PCI-X, PCIe, and AGP), and cooling devices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Processors can be multi-core and contain very fast cache memory: L1 cache inside the processor and L2 cache outside the processor but inside the chip. Processors can also support L3 cache.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Processors use HyperThreading to make efficient use of processor time.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Processors must be kept cool with fans and/or heat sinks. A thermal paste is applied between a heat sink and a processor.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ The clock speed refers to the processorâs internal clock. This is not the same as the FSB or bus speed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ CPU throttling slows down the processor to prevent overheating.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ PCI/PCI-X is a 32- and 64-bit parallel bus. The AGP expansion slot has a dedicated path for video to the processor. PCI, PCI-X, and AGP have been replaced with the point-to-point serial PCIe bus.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ PCIe slots have a specific number of bidirectional lanes that are the maximum a card can use. A PCIe adapter can fit in a slot of the same number of lanes or a higher number of lanes.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ A chipset is one or more chips that coordinate communication between the processor and the rest of the motherboard. A chipset could have an MCH (north bridge) to coordinate between the CPU and some expansion slots as well as memory. The chipset could also have a ICH (south bridge) to coordinate between the CPU and the rest of the motherboard expansion slots and ports. The chipset dictates the maximum number and type of slots and ports on a motherboard. AMD and Intel have created technologies to address the slowness of the FSB: HyperTransport, QPI, and DMI.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Laptops use mini PCI/PCIe slots for adapters and can use ExpressCards if the laptops have a slot in the side for these type of cards.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When replacing a motherboard, ensure that the CPU socket and number/types of expansion slots are appropriate. When replacing a laptop motherboard, additional components may have to be removed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When replacing or upgrading the CPU, ensure that the motherboard supports the processor and that the heating device is attached before powering on the computer. When replacing a laptop CPU, a screw may have to be loosened before you can remove the old processor.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ When replacing a CPU, ensure that the heat sink or fan is attached before powering on the computer.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">â¢ Active listening is an important skill for a technician. Donât be distracted by people or technology, take notes, make good eye contact, and ask directed questions when appropriate.</p>
